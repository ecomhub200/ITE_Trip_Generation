Trip Generation Manual, 11th Edition (TGM) is a publication of the Institute of Transportation 
Engineers (ITE). TGM is an educational tool for planners, transportation professionals, zoning boards, 
and others who are interested in estimating trip generation at a proposed development.
TGM includes a complete set of searchable electronic files including land use descriptions and 
data plots for all available combinations of land uses, time periods, independent variables, and 
settings. Data contained in TGM are presented for informational purposes only and do not include 
ITE recommendations on the best course of action or the preferred application of the data. The 
information is based on trip generation studies submitted voluntarily to ITE by public agencies, 
developers, consulting firms, student chapters, and associations.
TGM provides access for users to the ITETripGen web app. This desktop application allows electronic 
access to the entire trip generation dataset with numerous filtering capabilities including site setting 
(i.e., rural, general urban/suburban, dense multi-use urban, center city core), geographic location, age 
of data, and development size. Instructions for using ITETripGen are included within the app.
Additional data are needed from the profession to create a data-rich environment for trip generation 
analysis. ITE will continue to prepare updates to TGM.
User comments on TGM are invited. ITE continually seeks ways to increase the value of this document 
and requests that users provide recently collected data for the land uses presented in TGM or any 
other land uses for inclusion in future editions and updates.
Although this report provides a powerful tool to better understand site-generated vehicle and person 
trips, it contains information that can also be easily misinterpreted without sound professional 
judgment. Users are cautioned to use professional judgment in applying all data contained in this 
report. They also need to be cognizant of site and area characteristics that can affect trip generation 
(e.g., availability of transit services, demand management strategies, parking pricing) and of the 
continued need for additional data. Lack of appreciation of these factors may lead to an inaccurate 
estimate of vehicle and person trip generation and ultimately the improper design of person and 
vehicle site access.

Land Use: 215
Single-Family Attached Housing
Description
Single-family attached housing includes any single-family housing unit that shares a wall with an 
adjoining dwelling unit, whether the walls are for living space, a vehicle garage, or storage space.
Additional Data
The database for this land use includes duplexes (defined as a single structure with two distinct 
dwelling units, typically joined side-by-side and each with at least one outside entrance) and 
townhouses/rowhouses (defined as a single structure with three or more distinct dwelling units, 
joined side-by-side in a row and each with an outside entrance).
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this land use. 
The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip generation resource 
page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in British Columbia (CAN), 
California, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ontario (CAN), Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Land Use: 220
Multifamily Housing (Low-Rise)
Description
Low-rise multifamily housing includes apartments, townhouses, and condominiums located within the 
same building with at least three other dwelling units and that have two or three floors (levels). Various 
configurations fit this description, including walkup apartment, mansion apartment, and stacked 
townhouse.
•	 A walkup apartment typically is two or three floors in height with dwelling units that are accessed 
by a single or multiple entrances with stairways and hallways.
•	 A mansion apartment is a single structure that contains several apartments within what appears 
to be a single-family dwelling unit.
•	 A fourplex is a single two-story structure with two matching dwelling units on the ground and 
second floors. Access to the individual units is typically internal to the structure and provided 
through a central entry and stairway.
•	 A stacked townhouse is designed to match the external appearance of a townhouse. But, unlike 
a townhouse dwelling unit that only shares walls with an adjoining unit, the stacked townhouse 
units share both floors and walls. Access to the individual units is typically internal to the 
structure and provided through a central entry and stairway.
Multifamily housing (mid-rise) (Land Use 221), multifamily housing (high-rise) (Land Use 222), 
affordable housing (Land Use 223), and off-campus student apartment (low-rise) (Land Use 225) are 
related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
Data are presented for two subcategories for this land use: (1) not close to rail transit and (2) close to 
rail transit. A site is considered close to rail transit if the walking distance between the residential site 
entrance and the closest rail transit station entrance is ½ mile or less.
Additional Data
For the three sites for which both the number of residents and the number of occupied dwelling units 
were available, there were an average of 2.72 residents per occupied dwelling unit.
For the two sites for which the numbers of both total dwelling units and occupied dwelling units were 
available, an average of 96.2 percent of the total dwelling units were occupied.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this land 
use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip generation 
Dense Multi-Use Urban and Center City Core 

--- Page 20 ---
resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-and-parking-
generation/).
For the three sites for which data were provided for both occupied dwelling units and residents, there 
was an average of 2.72 residents per occupied dwelling unit.
It is expected that the number of bedrooms and number of residents are likely correlated to the trips 
generated by a residential site. To assist in future analysis, trip generation studies of all multifamily 
housing should attempt to obtain information on occupancy rate and on the mix of residential unit 
sizes (i.e., number of units by number of bedrooms at the site complex).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, the 2010s, and the 2020s in British 
Columbia (CAN), California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ontario (CAN), Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Washington.

Land Use: 221
Multifamily Housing (Mid-Rise)
Description
Mid-rise multifamily housing includes apartments and condominiums located in a building that has 
between four and 10 floors of living space. Access to individual dwelling units is through an outside 
building entrance, a lobby, elevator, and a set of hallways.
Multifamily housing (low-rise) (Land Use 220), multifamily housing (high-rise) (Land Use 222), off-
campus student apartment (mid-rise) (Land Use 226), and mid-rise residential with ground-floor 
commercial (Land Use 231) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
Data are presented for two subcategories for this land use: (1) not close to rail transit and (2) close to 
rail transit. A site is considered close to rail transit if the walking distance between the residential site 
entrance and the closest rail transit station entrance is ½ mile or less.
Additional Data
For the six sites for which both the number of residents and the number of occupied dwelling units 
were available, there were an average of 2.5 residents per occupied dwelling unit.
For the five sites for which the numbers of both total dwelling units and occupied dwelling units were 
available, an average of 96 percent of the total dwelling units were occupied.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this land 
use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip generation 
resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-and-parking-
generation/).
It is expected that the number of bedrooms and number of residents are likely correlated to the trips 
generated by a residential site. To assist in future analysis, trip generation studies of all multifamily 
housing should attempt to obtain information on occupancy rate and on the mix of residential unit 
sizes (i.e., number of units by number of bedrooms at the site complex).
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s, the 2000s, the 2010s, and the 2020s in Alberta (CAN), California, 
District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New 
Jersey, New York, Ontario (CAN), Oregon, Utah, and Virginia.

Land Use: 222
Multifamily Housing (High-Rise)
Description
High-rise multifamily housing includes apartments, townhouses, and condominiums. Each building 
has more than 10 floors of living space. Access to individual dwelling units is through an outside 
building entrance, a lobby, elevators, and a set of hallways.
Multifamily housing (low-rise) (Land Use 220), multifamily housing (mid-rise) (Land Use 221), off-
campus student apartment (high-rise) (Land Use 227), and high-rise residential with ground-floor 
commercial (Land Use 232) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
Data are presented for two subcategories for this land use: (1) not close to rail transit and (2) close to 
rail transit. A site is considered close to rail transit if the walking distance between the residential site 
entrance and the closest rail transit station entrance is ½ mile or less.
Additional Data
For the 12 sites for which both the number of residents and the number of occupied dwelling units 
were available, there were an average of 1.6 residents per occupied dwelling unit.
For the 26 sites for which the numbers of both total dwelling units and occupied dwelling units were 
available, an average of 98 percent of the total dwelling units were occupied.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this land use. 
The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip generation resource 
page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-and-parking-generation/).
For the 12 sites for which data were provided for both occupied dwelling units and residents, there 
was an average of 1.6 residents per occupied dwelling unit.
For the 26 sites for which data were provided for both occupied dwelling units and total dwelling units, 
an average of 98 percent of the units were occupied.
It is expected that the number of bedrooms and number of residents are likely correlated to the trips 
generated by a residential site. To assist in future analysis, trip generation studies of all multifamily 
housing should attempt to obtain information on occupancy rate and on the mix of residential unit 
sizes (i.e., number of units by number of bedrooms at the site complex).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, District of Columbia, 
Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ontario (CAN), Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.

Land Use: 223
Affordable Housing
Description
Affordable housing includes all multifamily housing that is rented at below market rate to 
households that include at least one employed member. Eligibility to live in affordable housing can 
be a function of limited household income and resident age. Multifamily housing (low-rise) (Land 
Use 220), multifamily housing (mid-rise) (Land Use 221), and multifamily housing (high-rise) (Land 
Use 222) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
Data are presented for three subcategories for this land use: (1) sites with income limitations for its 
tenants (denoted as income limits in the data plots), (2) sites with both minimum age thresholds and 
income limitations for its tenants (denoted as senior in the data plots), and (3) sites designed for and 
occupied by residents with special needs, such as persons with physical and mental impairments, 
single mothers, recovering addicts and others living in a group setting.
Additional Data
For most study sites contained in this land use, all dwelling units in the development are classified as 
affordable units. For residential study sites that provide a mix of market value and affordable units, the 
study sites with at least 75 percent of the dwelling units designated as affordable are also included in 
this land use database.
It is expected that the number of bedrooms and number of residents are likely correlated to the trips 
generated by a residential site. To assist in future analysis, trip generation studies of all multifamily 
housing should attempt to obtain information on occupancy rate and on the mix of residential unit 
sizes (i.e., number of units by number of bedrooms at the site complex).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s and 2010s in California, Ontario (CAN), and New Jersey.

Off-Campus Student Apartment (Low-Rise)
Description
An off-campus student apartment (low-rise) complex houses college or university students in 
structures with two or three floors of living space. The apartments are typically rented by the bedroom 
and most contain a common area or shared living space (living room, kitchen, dining area). Each 
bedroom typically has a private bath. These apartments are sometimes called independent bedroom 
apartments.
The dwelling unit typically ranges in size between a studio apartment and a five-bedroom apartment. It 
can be rented furnished or unfurnished. It is common for each apartment to have a washer and dryer.
The property is typically located near or within walking distance of a college campus and provides 
student-related amenities such as free high-speed Internet, a study lounge, fitness center, sports court, 
and swimming pool. An off-campus student apartment complex typically provides security and 24-
hour emergency maintenance.
Multifamily housing (low-rise) (Land Use 220), off-campus student apartment (mid-rise) (Land Use 
226), and off-campus student apartment (high-rise) (Land Use 227) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
The data included in this land use have been stratified into two subcategories: (1) sites located 
adjacent to campus and (2) sites located over a half mile from campus. For some of the latter sites, 
regular shuttle service is provided to and from the campus.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this land 
use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip generation 
resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-and-parking-
generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Minnesota, Montana, 
and South Carolina.

Off-Campus Student Apartment (Mid-Rise)
Description
An off-campus student apartment (mid-rise) complex houses college or university students in 
structures with between four and 10 floors of living space. The apartments are typically rented 
by the bedroom and most contain a common area or shared living space (living room, kitchen, 
dining area). Each bedroom typically has a private bath. These apartments are sometimes called 
independent bedroom apartments.
The dwelling unit typically ranges in size between a studio apartment and a five-bedroom 
apartment. It can be rented furnished or unfurnished. It is common for each apartment to have a 
washer and dryer.
The property is typically located near or within walking distance of a college campus and provides 
student-related amenities such as free high-speed Internet, a study lounge, fitness center, sports 
court, and swimming pool. An off-campus student apartment complex typically provides security 
and 24-hour emergency maintenance.
Multifamily housing (mid-rise) (Land Use 221), off-campus student apartment (low-rise) (Land Use 
225), and off-campus student apartment (high-rise) (Land Use 227) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
The data included in this land use have been stratified into two subcategories: (1) sites located 
adjacent to campus and (2) sites located over a half mile from campus. For some of the latter 
sites, regular shuttle service is provided to and from the campus.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in Arizona, California, Florida, and Minnesota.

Off-Campus Student Apartment (High-Rise)
Description
An off-campus student apartment (high-rise) complex houses college or university students in 
structures with more than 10 floors of living space. The apartments are typically rented by the 
bedroom and most contain a common area or shared living space (living room, kitchen, dining area). 
Each bedroom typically has a private bath. These apartments are sometimes called independent 
bedroom apartments.
The dwelling unit typically ranges in size between a studio apartment and a five-bedroom apartment. It 
can be rented furnished or unfurnished. It is common for each apartment to have a washer and dryer.
The property is typically located near or within walking distance of a college campus and provides 
student-related amenities such as free high-speed Internet, a study lounge, fitness center, sports court, 
and swimming pool. An off-campus student apartment complex typically provides security and 24-
hour emergency maintenance.
Multifamily housing (high-rise) (Land Use 222), off-campus student apartment (low-rise) (Land Use

Low-Rise Residential with Ground-Floor Commercial
Description
Low-rise residential with ground-floor commercial is a mixed-use multifamily housing building with two 
or three floors of residential living space and commercial space open to the public on the ground level. 
These facilities are typically found in dense multi-use urban and center city core settings. Multifamily 
housing (low-rise) (Land Use 220), mid-rise residential with ground floor commercial (Land Use 231), 
and high-rise residential with ground-floor commercial (Land Use 232) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
The data included in this land use have been stratified into two subcategories: (1) sites with a 
commercial gross leasable area that ranges between 1,000 and 25,000 square feet (2) sites with a 
commercial gross leasable area that ranges between 25,000 and 65,000 square feet.
Additional Data
The trips displayed in the data plots represent the total trips that enter or exit the site. Any trips internal 
to the site between its residential and commercial components are not included.
The ITE Trip Generation Handbook (TGH) presents an alternative approach for estimating trips generated 
by a site that fits this land use. The TGH method involves the estimation of the internal trip-making at a 
mixed-use site.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this land 
use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip generation 
resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-and-parking-
generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in the District of Columbia and Oregon.

Mid-Rise Residential with Ground-Floor Commercial
Description
Mid-rise residential with ground-floor commercial is a mixed-use multifamily housing building with 
between four and 10 floors of residential living space and commercial space open to the public 
on the ground level. These facilities are typically found in dense multi-use urban and center city 
core settings. Multifamily housing (mid-rise) (Land Use 221), low-rise residential with ground floor 
commercial (Land Use 230), and high-rise residential with ground-floor commercial (Land Use 
232) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
The data included in this land use have been stratified into two subcategories: (1) sites with a 
commercial gross leasable area that ranges between 1,000 and 25,000 square feet (2) sites with a 
commercial gross leasable area that ranges between 25,000 and 65,000 square feet.
Additional Data
The trips displayed in the data plots represent the total trips that enter or exit the site. Any trips 
internal to the site between its residential and commercial components are not included.
The ITE Trip Generation Handbook (TGH) presents an alternative approach for estimating trips 
generated by a site that fits this land use. The TGH method involves the estimation of the internal 
trip-making at a mixed-use site.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), District of Columbia, and Utah.

High-Rise Residential with Ground-Floor Commercial
Description
High-rise residential with ground-floor commercial is a mixed-use multifamily housing building with 
more than 10 floors of residential living space and commercial space open to the public on the 
ground level. These facilities are typically found in dense multi-use urban and center city core settings. 
Multifamily housing (high-rise) (Land Use 222), low-rise residential with ground floor commercial (Land 
Use 230), and mid-rise residential with ground-floor commercial (Land Use 231) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
The data included in this land use have been stratified into two subcategories: (1) sites with a 
commercial gross leasable area that ranges between 1,000 and 25,000 square feet (2) sites with a 
commercial gross leasable area that ranges between 25,000 and 65,000 square feet.
Additional Data
The trips displayed in the data plots represent the total trips that enter or exit the site. Any trips internal 
to the site between its residential and commercial components are not included.
The ITE Trip Generation Handbook (TGH) presents an alternative approach for estimating trips generated 
by a site that fits this land use. The TGH method involves the estimation of the internal trip-making at a 
mixed-use site.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this land 
use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip generation 
resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-and-parking-
generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in the District of Columbia.

Senior Adult Housing—Multifamily
Description
Senior adult housing—multifamily sites are independent living developments that are called various 
names including retirement communities, age-restricted housing, and active adult communities. The 
development has a specific age restriction for its residents, typically a minimum of 55 years of age 
for at least one resident of the household.
Residents in these communities are typically considered active and requiring little to no medical 
supervision. The percentage of retired residents varies by development. The development may include 
amenities such as a golf course, swimming pool, 24-hour security, transportation, and common 
recreational facilities. They generally lack centralized dining and on-site health facilities.
The dwelling units share both floors and walls with other units in the residential building. Senior adult 
housing—single-family (Land Use 251), congregate care facility (Land Use 253), assisted living (Land 
Use 254), and continuing care retirement community (Land Use 255) are related land uses.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this land 
use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip generation 
resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-and-parking-
generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2000s in Alberta (CAN), California, Maryland, 
New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ontario (CAN), and Pennsylvania.

Continuing Care Retirement Community
Description
A continuing care retirement community (CCRC) is a land use that provides multiple elements 
of senior adult living. A CCRC enables a resident to transition in place from independent living 
to increased care as the medical needs of the resident change. Housing options may include 
various combinations of senior adult housing (both single-family and multifamily), congregate 
care, assisted living, and nursing home. The community may also contain special services such 
as medical, dining, recreational, communal transportation, and some limited, supporting retail 
facilities. A CCRC is usually a self-contained village. Senior adult housing—single-family (Land Use 
251), senior adult housing—multifamily (Land Use 252), congregate care facility (Land Use 253), 
assisted living (Land Use 254), and nursing home (Land Use 620) are related uses.
Additional Data
Caution should be used when applying these data. CCRC developments consist of various housing 
components (dwelling units, rooms, and beds) that often exist in varying proportions. Therefore, 
the use of a single housing component may not fully represent the trip generation characteristics 
of these communities. The comprehensive independent variable—units—is the descriptor used in 
the data plots. This variable represents an aggregate of dwelling units for the single-family and 
congregate components of the CCRC and the beds in the assisted living component. To illustrate 
the varying proportions of housing options that exist in the database, the following table describes 
the residential units for nine of the CCRCs in the database.

A complete study of CCRCs requires future analysis of their various components. Therefore, it 
is important to collect as much information as possible. At the very least, the total number of 
dwelling units, rooms, and beds should be obtained; if possible, the number of corresponding 
occupied units should be recorded as well.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Connecticut, Illinois, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Ontario (CAN), Pennsylvania, and Virginia.

Hotel
Description
A hotel is a place of lodging that provides sleeping accommodations and supporting facilities 
such as a full-service restaurant, cocktail lounge, meeting rooms, banquet room, and convention 
facilities. A hotel typically provides a swimming pool or another recreational facility such as a 
fitness room. All suites hotel (Land Use 311), business hotel (Land Use 312), motel (Land Use 
320), and resort hotel (Land Use 330) are related uses.
Additional Data
Twenty-five studies provided information on occupancy rates at the time the studies were 
conducted. The average occupancy rate for these studies was approximately 82 percent.
Some properties in this land use provide guest transportation services (e.g., airport shuttle, 
limousine service, golf course shuttle service) which may have an impact on the overall trip 
generation rates.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, District 
of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Minnesota, New York, Ontario (CAN), Pennsylvania, South 
Dakota, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.
For all lodging uses, it is important to collect data on occupied rooms as well as total rooms in 
order to accurately predict trip generation characteristics for the site.
Trip generation at a hotel may be related to the presence of supporting facilities such as 
convention facilities, restaurants, meeting/banquet space, and retail facilities. Future data 
submissions should specify the presence of these amenities. Reporting the level of activity 
at the supporting facilities such as full, empty, partially active, number of people attending a 
meeting/banquet during observation may also be useful in further analysis of this land use.

All Suites Hotel
Description
An all suites hotel is a place of lodging that provides sleeping accommodations, a small 
restaurant and lounge, and small amounts of meeting space. Each suite includes a sitting room 
and separate bedroom. An in-room kitchen is often provided. Hotel (Land Use 310), business hotel 
(Land Use 312), motel (Land Use 320), and resort hotel (Land Use 330) are related uses.
Additional Data
Six studies provided information on occupancy rates at the time the studies were conducted. The 
average occupancy rate for these studies was approximately 74 percent.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2010s in Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, 
Montana, Virginia, and Washington.
For all lodging uses, it is important to collect data on occupied rooms as well as total rooms in 
order to accurately predict trip generation characteristics for the site.

Business Hotel
Description
A business hotel is a place of lodging aimed toward the business traveler but also accommodates 
a growing number of recreational travelers. These hotels provide sleeping accommodations and 
other limited facilities, such as a breakfast buffet bar and afternoon beverage bar. Some provide a 
full-service restaurant geared toward hotel guests. Some provide a swimming pool; most provide 
fitness facilities. Limited space for meeting facilities may be provided. Each unit is a large single 
room. Hotel (Land Use 310), all suites hotel (Land Use 311), motel (Land Use 320), and resort 
hotel (Land Use 330) are related uses.
Additional Data
Ten studies provided information on room occupancy at the time of data collection. The average 
occupancy rate for these sites was approximately 86 percent.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The average numbers of person trips per vehicle trip at the three general urban/suburban sites at 
which both person trip and vehicle trip data were collected, were as follows:
•	 1.3 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 7 and 9 a.m.
•	 1.3 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 4 and 6 p.m.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2010s in the District of Columbia, 
Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Minnesota, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
For all lodging uses, it is important to collect data on occupied rooms as well as total rooms in 
order to accurately predict trip generation characteristics for the site.

General Office Building
Description
A general office building is a location where affairs of businesses, commercial or industrial 
organizations, or professional persons or firms are conducted. An office building houses multiple 
tenants that can include, as examples, professional services, insurance companies, investment 
brokers, a banking institution, a restaurant, or other service retailers. A general office building 
with a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet or less is classified as a small office building (Land 
Use 712). Corporate headquarters building (Land Use 714), single tenant office building (Land 
Use 715), medical-dental office building (Land Use 720), office park (Land Use 750), research 
and development center (Land Use 760), and business park (Land Use 770) are additional related 
uses.
Additional Data
If two or more general office buildings are in close physical proximity (within a close walk) and 
function as a unit (perhaps with a shared parking facility and common or complementary tenants), 
the total gross floor area or employment of the paired office buildings can be used for calculating 
the site trip generation. If the individual buildings are isolated or not functionally related to one 
another, trip generation should be calculated for each building separately.
For study sites with reported gross floor area and employees, an average employee density of 
3.3 employees per 1,000 square feet GFA (or roughly 300 square feet per employee) has been 
consistent through the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. No sites counted in the 2010s reported both GFA 
and employees.
The average building occupancy varies considerably within the studies for which occupancy data 
were provided. The reported occupied gross floor area was 88 percent for general urban/suburban 
sites and 96 percent for the center city core and dense multi-use urban sites.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The average numbers of person trips per vehicle trip at the eight center city core sites at which 
both person trip and vehicle trip data were collected are as follows:
•	 2.8 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 7 and 9 a.m.
•	 2.9 during Weekday, AM Peak Hour of Generator
•	 2.9 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 4 and 6 p.m.
Dense Multi-Use Urban and Center City Core

•	 3.0 during Weekday, PM Peak Hour of Generator
The average numbers of person trips per vehicle trip at the 18 dense multi-use urban sites at 
which both person trip and vehicle trip data were collected are as follows:
•	 1.5 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 7 and 9 a.m.
•	 1.5 during Weekday, AM Peak Hour of Generator
•	 1.5 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 4 and 6 p.m.
•	 1.5 during Weekday, PM Peak Hour of Generator
The average numbers of person trips per vehicle trip at the 23 general urban/suburban sites at 
which both person trip and vehicle trip data were collected are as follows:
•	 1.3 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 7 and 9 a.m.
•	 1.3 during Weekday, AM Peak Hour of Generator
•	 1.3 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 4 and 6 p.m.
•	 1.4 during Weekday, PM Peak Hour of Generator
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, the 2010s, and the 2020s in Alberta 
(CAN), California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, 
Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, 
Ontario (CAN)Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington.

Small Office Building
Description
A small office building is the same as a general office building (Land Use 710) but with less than or 
equal to 10,000 square feet of gross floor area. The building typically houses a single tenant. It is a 
location where affairs of a business, commercial or industrial organization, or professional person or 
firm are conducted. General office building (Land Use 710) is a related use.
Additional Data
Attorney office, mortgage company, financial advisor, insurance agency, home health care provider, 
and real estate company are examples of tenants included in the small office building database. The 
diversity of employer types results in a wide range in employee density in the database. Densities 
range from a high of 1,300 to a low of 240 square feet per employee with an overall average of nearly 
600 square feet per employee (a value much larger than the average observed in a general office 
building study sites).
In addition to the significant difference in employee density, small office buildings tend to be 
dominated by a single tenant (or very few) that are more service-oriented than a typical general office 
building. The result is more frequent and regular visitors and higher trip generation rates.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this land 
use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip generation 
resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-and-parking-
generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), California, Texas, and 
Wisconsin.

Free-Standing Discount Superstore
Description
A discount superstore is similar to a free-standing discount store described in Land Use 815 with 
the exception that it also contains a full-service grocery department under the same roof that shares 
entrances and exits with the discount store area. These stores usually offer a variety of customer 
services, centralized cashiering, and a wide range of products. They typically maintain long store hours 
7 days a week. The stores included in this land use are often the only ones on the site, but they can 
also be found in mutual operation with a related or unrelated garden center or service station, or as 
a part of a shopping center, with or without their own dedicated parking area. Freestanding discount 
store (Land Use 815) is a related use.
Additional Data
A garden center contained within the principal outside faces of the exterior building walls is included 
in the reported gross floor area. An outdoor or fenced-in area outside the principal faces of the exterior 
walls is excluded. Several sites included in this land use indicate the presence of fenced/covered space.
A Texas Transportation Institute study titled “Nationwide Discount Supercenter Study” published in 
2008 provides information on trip generation rates for what the study defines as “typical” and “peak” 
seasons. The peak season is defined as the period between the week after Thanksgiving and the week 
prior to Christmas. The typical season is defined as September through mid-November when sales 
transactions are close to the annual average. The following are their key findings:
•	 Weekday trip generation rates are similar in both seasons
•	 Saturday trip generation rates are 13 to 20 percent higher during the peak season than the 
typical season
•	 Sunday trip generation rates are 6 to 10 percent higher during the peak season
The weighted average truck trip generation rates from approximately 30 sites surveyed for this land 
use are summarized in the table below. The average gross floor area of these facilities is 206,000 
square feet.

To assist in the future analysis of this land use, it is important to collect and include information on the 
presence and size of garden centers, outdoor fenced-in space, and service stations in trip generation 
data submissions.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this land 
use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip generation 
resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-and-parking-
generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alabama, Arkansas, California, 
Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, 
Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Variety Store
Description
A variety store is a retail store that sells a broad range of inexpensive items often at a uniform 
price. A variety store is commonly referred to as a “dollar store.” Items typically sold at a variety 
store include kitchen supplies, cleaning products, home office supplies, food products, household 
goods, decorations, and toys. The store can be stand-alone or located within a shopping plaza or 
strip retail plaza. Free-standing discount store (Land Use 815) is a related use.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s and 2020s in Florida, Minnesota, and Texas.

Description
A hardware/paint store is a free-standing building that sells hardware and paint supplies. Building 
materials and lumber store (Land Use 812) and home improvement superstore (Land Use 862) are 
related uses.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s and the 2010s in California, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, and 
Wisconsin.

Land Use: 821
Shopping Plaza (40–150k)
Description
A shopping plaza is an integrated group of commercial establishments that is planned, developed, 
owned, and managed as a unit. Each study site in this land use has between 40,000 and 150,000 
square feet of gross leasable area (GLA). The term “plaza” in the land use name rather than 
“center” is simply a means of distinction between the different shopping center size ranges. 
Various other names are commonly used to categorize a shopping plaza within this size range, 
depending on its specific size and tenants, such as neighborhood center, community center, and 
fashion center.
Its major tenant is often a supermarket but many sites are anchored by home improvement, 
discount, or other stores. A shopping plaza typically contains more than retail merchandising 
facilities. Office space, a movie theater, restaurants, a post office, banks, a health club, and 
recreational facilities are common tenants. A shopping plaza is almost always open-air and the GLA 
is the same as the gross floor area of the building.
The 150,000 square feet GLA threshold value between shopping plaza and shopping center 
(Land Use 820) is based on an examination of trip generation data. For a shopping plaza that is 
smaller than the threshold value, the presence or absence of a supermarket within the plaza has 
a measurable effect on site trip generation. For a shopping center that is larger than the threshold 
value, the trips generated by its other major tenants mask any effects of the presence or absence 
of an on-site supermarket.
The 40,000 square feet GFA threshold between shopping plaza and strip retail plaza (Land Use 
822) was selected based on an examination of the overall shopping center/plaza database. No 
shopping plaza with a supermarket as its anchor is smaller than 40,000 square feet GLA.
Shopping center (>150k) (Land Use 820), strip retail plaza (<40k) (Land Use 822), and factory 
outlet center (Land Use 823) are related uses.
Land Use Subcategory
The presence or absence of a supermarket in a shopping plaza has been determined to have a 
measurable effect on site trip generation. Therefore, data are presented for two subcategories for 
this land use: sites with a supermarket anchor and sites without a supermarket.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).

Supermarket
Description
A supermarket is a free-standing retail store that sells a complete assortment of food, beverage, 
food preparation materials, and household products. A supermarket may also provide additional 
products and services such as a bakery, dry cleaning, floral arrangements, greeting cards, a 
limited-service bank, and a pharmacy.
Additional Data
In prior editions of Trip Generation Manual, a separate land use code was assigned to a discount 
supermarket. With the addition of new supermarket data points, an examination of the database 
reveals very little difference between trip generation rates for the traditional supermarket and a 
reported discount supermarket. This examination looked at both the small discount supermarkets 
and the large discount supermarkets. As a result, all types of supermarkets are included in this 
land use database.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, the 2010s, and the 2020s in Alberta 
(CAN), California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, 
Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ontario (CAN), Oregon, Pennsylvania, South 
Dakota, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Convenience Store
Description
A convenience store is a small retail business that sells grocery and other everyday items that a 
person may need or want as a matter of convenience. Convenience stores are typically located 
along major thoroughfares to optimize motorist convenience. Extended hours of operation (with 
many open 24 hours, 7 days a week) further support the convenience of the store. A convenience 
store is also commonly called a convenience market.
The product mix typically includes pre-packaged grocery items, beverages, dairy products, snack 
foods, confectionary, tobacco products, over-the-counter drugs, and toiletries. A convenience 
store may sell alcohol, often limited to beer and wine.
Coffee and pre-made sandwiches are also commonly sold at a convenience store. Made-to-order 
food orders are sometimes offered. Some stores offer limited seating.
Convenience store/gas station (Land Use 945) is a related use.

Land Use: 862
Home Improvement Superstore
Description
A home improvement superstore is a free-standing facility that specializes in the sale of home 
improvement merchandise. The store generally offers a variety of customer services and 
centralized cashiering. A home improvement superstore typically maintains long store hours 7 
days a week. Examples of items sold in the store include lumber, tools, paint, lighting, wallpaper 
and paneling, kitchen and bathroom fixtures, lawn equipment, and plant and garden accessories. 
The stores included in this land use are often the only ones on the site, but they can also be found 
in mutual operation with a related or unrelated garden center. A home improvement superstore 
is sometimes placed as a separate parcel within a retail complex, with or without its own 
dedicated parking. The buildings contained in this land use usually range in size between 50,000 
and 200,000 square feet gross floor area. This land use does not include interior design stores. 
Building materials and lumber store (Land Use 812) and hardware/paint store (Land Use 816) are 
related uses.
Additional Data
Outside storage areas are not included in the overall gross floor area measurements. However, if a 
storage area is located within the principal outside faces of the exterior walls, it is included in the 
overall gross floor area of the building.
A garden center that is contained within the principal outside faces of the exterior building walls is 
included in the reported gross floor area. An outdoor or fenced-in area outside the principal faces 
of the exterior building walls is excluded.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Arizona, California, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Ontario 
(CAN), Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
To assist in the future analysis of this land use, it is important to collect and include information 
on the presence and size of garden centers, outdoor fenced-in space, and service stations in trip 
generation data submissions.

Drive-in Bank
Description
A bank is a financial institution that can offer a wide variety of financial services. A drive-in bank 
provides banking services for a motorist through a teller station. A drive-in bank may also serve 
patrons who walk into the building. The drive-in lanes may or may not provide an automatic teller 
machine (ATM). Walk-in bank (Land Use 911) is a related use.
Additional Data
The independent variable—drive-in lanes—refers to all lanes at a banking facility used for financial 
transactions, including ATM-only lanes.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2000s and the 2010s in Colorado, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, 
New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and 
Wisconsin.
To assist in the future analysis of this land use, it is important that Friday data be collected and 
reported separately from weekday data. It is also important to specify the date and month of the 
data collection period and the number of drive-through lanes that are open at the time of the 
study.

Fast Casual Restaurant
Description
A fast casual restaurant is a sit-down restaurant with no (or very limited) wait staff or table 
service. A customer typically orders off a menu board, pays for food before the food is prepared, 
and seats themselves. The menu generally contains higher-quality, made-to-order food items 
with fewer frozen or processed ingredients than at a fast-food restaurant. Most patrons eat their 
meal within the restaurant, but a significant proportion of the restaurant sales can be carry-out 
orders. A fast casual restaurant typically serves lunch and dinner; some serve breakfast. A typical 
duration of stay for an eat-in customer is 40 minutes or less. Fine dining restaurant (Land Use 
931), high-turnover (sit-down) restaurant (Land Use 932), and fast-food restaurant without drive-
through window (Land Use 933) are related uses.
Additional Data
The fast casual restaurant study sites included in this land use did not have a drive-through 
window.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in Minnesota, South Carolina, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Fine Dining Restaurant
Description
A fine dining restaurant is a full-service eating establishment with a typical duration of stay of at 
least 1 hour. A fine dining restaurant generally does not serve breakfast; some do not serve lunch; 
all serve dinner. This type of restaurant often requests and sometimes requires a reservation and 
is generally not part of a chain. A patron commonly waits to be seated, is served by wait staff, 
orders from a menu and pays after the meal. Some of the study sites have lounge or bar facilities 
(serving alcoholic beverages), but meal service is the primary draw to the restaurant. Fast casual 
restaurant (Land Use 930) and high-turnover (sit-down) restaurant (Land Use 932) are related 
uses.
Additional Data
If the fine dining restaurant has outdoor seating, its area is not included in the overall gross floor 
area. For a restaurant that has significant outdoor seating, the number of seats may be more 
reliable than GFA as an independent variable on which to establish a trip generation rate.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), California, 
Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, New Jersey, and Utah.

Land Use: 932
High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant
Description
This land use consists of sit-down, full-service eating establishments with a typical duration of 
stay of 60 minutes or less. This type of restaurant is usually moderately priced, frequently belongs 
to a restaurant chain, and is commonly referred to as casual dining. Generally, these restaurants 
serve lunch and dinner; they may also be open for breakfast and are sometimes open 24 hours 
a day. These restaurants typically do not accept reservations. A patron commonly waits to be 
seated, is served by wait staff, orders from a menu, and pays after the meal.
Some facilities offer carry-out for a small proportion of its customers. Some facilities within this 
land use may also contain a bar area for serving food and alcoholic drinks.
Fast casual restaurant (Land Use 930), fine dining restaurant (Land Use 931), fast-food restaurant 
without drive-through window (Land Use 933), and fast-food restaurant with drive-through window 
(Land Use 934) are related uses.
Additional Data
Users should exercise caution when applying statistics during the AM peak periods, as the sites 
contained in the database for this land use may or may not be open for breakfast. In cases where 
it was confirmed that the sites were not open for breakfast, data for the AM peak hour of the 
adjacent street traffic were removed from the database.
If the restaurant has outdoor seating, its area is not included in the overall gross floor area. For 
a restaurant that has significant outdoor seating, the number of seats may be more reliable than 
GFA as an independent variable on which to establish a trip generation rate.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New 
Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, 
Vermont, and Wisconsin.

Fast-Food Restaurant without Drive-Through Window
Description
This land use includes any fast-food restaurant without a drive-through window. This type of 
restaurant is characterized by a large carry-out clientele, long hours of service (some are open 
for breakfast, all are open for lunch and dinner, some are open late at night or 24 hours a day) 
and high turnover rates for eat-in customers. These limited-service eating establishments do not 
provide table service. A patron generally orders from a menu board and pays before receiving 
the meal. A typical duration of stay for an eat-in customer is less than 30 minutes. Fast casual 
restaurant (Land Use 930), high-turnover (sit-down) restaurant (Land Use 932), and fast-food 
restaurant with drive-through window (Land Use 934) are related uses.
Additional Data
If the restaurant has outdoor seating, its area is not included in the overall gross floor area. For 
a restaurant that has significant outdoor seating, the number of seats may be more reliable than 
GFA as an independent variable on which to establish a trip generation rate.

land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-

Land Use: 936
Coffee/Donut Shop without Drive-Through Window
Description
This land use includes any coffee and donut restaurant that does not have a drive-through 
window. The restaurant sells freshly brewed coffee (along with coffee-related accessories) and a 
variety of food/drink products such as donuts, bagels, breads, muffins, cakes, sandwiches, wraps, 
salads, and other hot and cold beverages. The restaurant marketing and sales may emphasize 
coffee beverages over food (or vice versa).
A coffee/donut shop typically holds long store hours (more than 15 hours) with an early morning 
opening. Limited indoor seating is generally provided for patrons, but table service is not provided.
Coffee/donut shop with drive-through window (Land Use 937) and coffee/donut shop with drive-
through window and no indoor seating (Land Use 938) are related uses.
Additional Data
Many of the facilities in this land use were located within a shopping center or as an outparcel to 
a shopping center.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.
Specialized Land Use Data
One study provided data for a coffee/donut shop without a drive-through window that sells 
donuts and ice cream (source 563). The trip generating characteristics of this site differed from 
the sites included in this land use; therefore, trip generation information for this site is presented 
here and was excluded from the data plots. The site had a gross floor area of 2,400 square feet. 
It generated 48 vehicle trips during the weekday PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic and 52 
vehicle trips during the weekday PM peak hour of the generator.

Land Use: 937
Coffee/Donut Shop with Drive-Through Window
Description
This land use includes any coffee and donut restaurant that has a drive-through window as well as 
a walk-in entrance area at which a patron can purchase and consume items. The restaurant sells 
freshly brewed coffee (along with coffee-related accessories) and a variety of food/drink products 
such as donuts, bagels, breads, muffins, cakes, sandwiches, wraps, salads, and other hot and cold 
beverages. The restaurant marketing and sales may emphasize coffee beverages over food (or 
vice versa).
A coffee/donut shop typically holds long store hours (more than 15 hours) with an early morning 
opening. Limited indoor seating is generally provided for patrons, but table service is not provided.
Coffee/donut shop without drive-through window (Land Use 936) and coffee/donut shop with 
drive-through window and no indoor seating (Land Use 938) are related uses.
Additional Data
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, 
Ontario (CAN), Pennsylvania, Quebec (CAN), Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
Specialized Land Use Data
One study was conducted during the pandemic in 2020. Twelve sites were counted in Illinois and 
Missouri during the AM and PM adjacent street peak hours. The data have not been incorporated 
within the overall ITE trip generation database and are not reflected in the data plots for this land 
use. Consideration for their inclusion will be given for the 12th Edition of Trip Generation Manual 
after additional post-pandemic data are collected. Overall, the pandemic counts yielded an AM 
adjacent street peak weighted average rate of 84 vehicle trips per 1,000 square feet GFA, roughly 
equivalent to the pre-pandemic average. The PM adjacent street peak rate was 56 (roughly 40 
percent higher than the pre-pandemic value). The higher PM peak rate for these coffee/donut 
shops conforms with anecdotal observations that with the temporary or permanent closures of 
many restaurants during the pandemic, the drive-through restaurants that were open did a brisk 
business even during their off-peak periods.

Land Use: 944
Gasoline/Service Station
Description
This land use includes gasoline/service stations where the primary business is the fueling of 
motor vehicles. The sites included generally have a small building (less than 2,000 gross square 
feet) that houses a cashier and limited space for motor vehicle maintenance supplies and general 
convenience products. A gasoline/service station may also have facilities for servicing and 
repairing motor vehicles. The gasoline/service station may also have a car wash. Convenience 
store/gas station (Land Use 945) and truck stop (Land Use 950) are related uses.
Additional Data
The independent variable—vehicle fueling positions—is defined as the maximum number of 
vehicles that can be fueled simultaneously. The sites in this land use include both self-pump and 
attendant-pumped fueling positions and both pre-pay and post-pay operations.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, 
Ontario (CAN), Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, and Washington.
Specialized Land Use Data
A 2006 study provided data on four private fuel facilities in Florida (source 721). These facilities 
provide self-fuel service for any motorist with a pre-established membership account. The site is 
not open to the general public. The trip generation characteristics of these sites differ from sites 
included in this land use; therefore, trip generation information for these sites is excluded from the 
data plots. The four sites have an average of nine vehicle fueling positions, with an average of 12 
vehicle trips during the weekday, AM peak hour of adjacent traffic and 7 vehicle trips during the 
weekday, PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic.

Convenience Store/Gas Station
Description
A convenience store/gas station is a facility with a co-located convenience store and gas station. 
The convenience store sells grocery and other everyday items that a person may need or want as 
a matter of convenience. The gas station sells automotive fuels such as gasoline and diesel.
A convenience store/gas station is typically located along a major thoroughfare to optimize 
motorist convenience. Extended hours of operation (with many open 24 hours, 7 days a week) are 
common at these facilities.
The convenience store product mix typically includes pre-packaged grocery items, beverages, 
dairy products, snack foods, confectionary, tobacco products, over-the-counter drugs, and 
toiletries. A convenience store may sell alcohol, often limited to beer and wine. Coffee and pre-
made sandwiches are also commonly sold at a convenience store. Made-to-order food orders are 
sometimes offered. Some stores offer limited seating.
The sites in this land use include both self-pump and attendant-pumped fueling positions and 
both pre-pay and post-pay operations.
Convenience store (Land Use 851), gasoline/service station (Land Use 944), and truck stop (Land 
Use 950) are related uses.
Land Use Subcategory
Multiple subcategories were added to this land use to allow for multi-variable evaluation of sites 
with single-variable data plots. All study sites are assigned to one of three subcategories, based 
on the number of vehicle fueling positions (VFP) at the site: between 2 and 8 VFP, between 9 and 
15 VFP, and between 16 and 24 VFP. For each VFP range subcategory, data plots are presented 
with GFA as the independent variable for all time periods and trip types for which data are 
available. The use of both GFA and VFP (as the independent variable and land use subcategory, 
respectively) provides a significant improvement in the reliability of a trip generation estimate 
when compared to the single-variable data plots in prior editions of Trip Generation Manual.
Further, the study sites were also assigned to one of three other subcategories, based on the 
gross floor area (GFA) of the convenience store at the site: between 2,000 and 4,000 square 
feet, between 4,000 and 5,500 square feet, and between 5,500 and 10,000 square feet. For each 
GFA subcategory range, data plots are presented with VFP as the independent variable for all 
time periods and trip types for which data are available. The use of both VFP and GFA (as the 
independent variable and land use subcategory, respectively) provides a significant improvement 
in the reliability of a trip generation estimate when compared to the single-variable data plots in 
prior editions of Trip Generation Manual.
1034 Trip Generation Manual 11th Edition • Volume 2

--- Page 1045 ---
When analyzing the convenience store/gas station land use with each combination of GFA and 
VFP values as described above, the two sets of data plots will produce two estimates of site-
generated trips. Both values can be considered when determining a site trip generation estimate.
Data plots are also provided for three additional independent variables: AM peak hour traffic 
on adjacent street, PM peak hour traffic on adjacent street, and employees. These independent 
variables are intended to be analyzed as single independent variables and do not have sub-
categories associated with them. Within the data plots and within the ITETripGen web app, these 
plots are found under the land use subcategory “none.”
Additional Data
ITE recognizes there are existing convenience store/gas station sites throughout North America 
that are larger than the sites presented in the data plots. However, the ITE database does not 
include any site with more than 24 VFP or any site with gross floor area greater than 10,000 
square feet. Submission of trip generation data for larger sites is encouraged.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, 
South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Brewery Tap Room
Description
A brewery tap room is a designated area found in conjunction with a brewery in which customers 
can try samples of a brewery’s products. These rooms are typically located on-site and can be 
used as a way to sell beer or related products directly to the customer. Depending on its size, a 
tap room can also be used to house social gatherings. A brewery tap room may also be used to 
facilitate complimentary tours of the brewery.
Additional Data
For the purposes of this land use, the independent variable “1,000 sq. foot gross floor area” refers 
to the square footage of the building that houses the tap room.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in Florida and Minnesota.

Trip Generation Manual, 11th Edition (TGM) is a publication of the Institute of Transportation 
Engineers (ITE). TGM is an educational tool for planners, transportation professionals, zoning boards, 
and others who are interested in estimating trip generation at a proposed development.
TGM includes a complete set of searchable electronic files including land use descriptions and 
data plots for all available combinations of land uses, time periods, independent variables, and 
settings. Data contained in TGM are presented for informational purposes only and do not include 
ITE recommendations on the best course of action or the preferred application of the data. The 
information is based on trip generation studies submitted voluntarily to ITE by public agencies, 
developers, consulting firms, student chapters, and associations.
TGM provides access for users to the ITETripGen web app. This desktop application allows electronic 
access to the entire trip generation dataset with numerous filtering capabilities including site setting 
(i.e., rural, general urban/suburban, dense multi-use urban, center city core), geographic location, age 
of data, and development size. Instructions for using ITETripGen are included within the app.
Additional data are needed from the profession to create a data-rich environment for trip generation 
analysis. ITE will continue to prepare updates to TGM.
User comments on TGM are invited. ITE continually seeks ways to increase the value of this document 
and requests that users provide recently collected data for the land uses presented in TGM or any 
other land uses for inclusion in future editions and updates.
Although this report provides a powerful tool to better understand site-generated vehicle and person 
trips, it contains information that can also be easily misinterpreted without sound professional 
judgment. Users are cautioned to use professional judgment in applying all data contained in this 
report. They also need to be cognizant of site and area characteristics that can affect trip generation 
(e.g., availability of transit services, demand management strategies, parking pricing) and of the 
continued need for additional data. Lack of appreciation of these factors may lead to an inaccurate 
estimate of vehicle and person trip generation and ultimately the improper design of person and 
vehicle site access.

Park-and-Ride Lot with Bus or Light Rail Service
Description
A park-and-ride lot with bus or light rail service is an area used for the transfer of people between 
private vehicles and buses or light rail. It usually contains a passenger shelter and a parking 
lot and circulation facilities for buses and personal passenger vehicles. The site may contain 
ticketing facilities and other amenities such as restrooms, vending machines, and a coffee stand. 
In addition to the motorists that use the park-and-ride lot, the vehicles that enter or exit the site 
may include a significant number that drop off or pick up passengers.
Additional Data
For the 47 sites with data for both total and occupied parking spaces, the average occupancy rate 
was 73 percent with individual sites ranging between 27 and 100 percent.
Based on vehicle counts taken during presumed AM and PM peak periods at 10 sites, the morning 
and afternoon peak hours were on average between 6:45 and 7:45 a.m. and 5:15 and 6:15 pm., 
respectively. However, the peak hours varied significantly between stations based on the data 
submitted.
The average numbers of person trips per vehicle trip at the six general urban/suburban sites at 
which both person trip and vehicle trip data were collected were as follows:
•	 2.2 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 7 and 9 a.m.
•	 2.2 during Weekday, AM Peak Hour of Generator
•	 3.2 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 4 and 6 p.m.
•	 3.2 during Weekday, PM Peak Hour of Generator
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Colorado, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Washington.

Industrial Park
Description
An industrial park contains several individual industrial or related facilities. It is characterized by 
a mix of manufacturing, service, and warehouse facilities with a wide variation in the proportion 
of each type of use from one location to another. Many industrial parks contain highly diversified 
facilities. Some parks in the database have a large number of small businesses and others have 
one or two dominant industries. General light industrial (Land Use 110) and manufacturing (Land 
Use 140) are related uses.
Additional Data
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 2000s, 2010s, and the 2020s in California, Georgia, New 
Jersey, Massachusetts, New York, Ontario (CAN), and Pennsylvania.

Description
A manufacturing facility is an area where the primary activity is the conversion of raw materials 
or parts into finished products. Size and type of activity may vary substantially from one facility 
to another. In addition to the actual production of goods, a manufacturing facility typically has an 
office and may provide space for warehouse, research, and associated functions. General light 
industrial (Land Use 110) and industrial park (Land Use 130) are related uses.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, 
Texas, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia.

Mini-Warehouse
Description
A mini-warehouse is a building in which a number of storage units or vaults are rented for the 
storage of goods. They are typically referred to as “self-storage” facilities. Each unit is physically 
separated from other units, and access is usually provided through an overhead door or other 
common access point.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, Colorado, 
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Texas, and Utah.

High-Cube Transload and Short-Term 
Storage Warehouse
Description
A high-cube warehouse (HCW) is a building that typically has at least 200,000 gross square feet 
of floor area, has a ceiling height of 24 feet or more, and is used primarily for the storage and/
or consolidation of manufactured goods (and to a lesser extent, raw materials) prior to their 
distribution to retail locations or other warehouses. A typical HCW has a high level of on-site 
automation and logistics management. The automation and logistics enable highly-efficient 
processing of goods through the HCW. A high-cube warehouse can be free-standing or located in 
an industrial park.
The HCWs included in this land use include transload and short-term storage facilities. A 
transload facility has the primary function of consolidation and distribution of pallet loads 
(or larger) for manufacturers, wholesalers, or retailers. A transload facility typically has little 
storage duration, high throughput, and its operations are high efficiency. A short-term HCW is a 
distribution facility often with custom/special features built into the structure for the movement of 
large volumes of freight with only short-term storage of products.
Some limited assembly and repackaging may occur within the facility.
A high-cube warehouse may contain a mezzanine. In a HCW setting, a mezzanine is a free-
standing, semi-permanent structure that is commonly supported by structural steel columns 
and that is lined with racks or shelves. The gross floor area (GFA) values for the study sites in 
the database for this land use do NOT include the floor area of the mezzanine. The GFA values 
represent only the permanent ground-floor square footage.
The amount of office/employee welfare space that is provided within a HCW can be highly 
variable but is typically an insignificant portion of the overall building square footage. Within the 
trip generation database, common values are between 3,000 and 5,000 square feet for a Cold 
Storage HCW and between 5,000 and 10,000 square feet for Transload, Fulfillment Center, and 
Parcel Hub HCW (all of which are less than one percent of total GFA for a site). Therefore, for the 
trip generation data plots, any office space that is part of the normal operation of the warehouse 
is included in the total GFA.
Warehousing (Land Use 150), high-cube fulfillment center warehouse (Land Use 155), high-cube 
parcel hub warehouse (Land Use 156), and high-cube cold storage warehouse (Land Use 157) are 
related land uses.
The number of dock doors at a HCW is a potential independent variable. Future data 
submissions should include that information.

Additional Data
The High-Cube Warehouse/Distribution Center-related land uses underwent specialized 
consideration through a commissioned study titled “High-Cube Warehouse Vehicle Trip Generation 
Analysis,” published in October 2016. The results of this study are posted on the ITE website at 
http://library.ite.org/pub/a3e6679a-e3a8-bf38-7f29-2961becdd498.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), California, 
Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington.

High-Cube Fulfillment Center Warehouse
Description
A high-cube warehouse (HCW) is a building that typically has at least 200,000 gross square feet 
of floor area, has a ceiling height of 24 feet or more, and is used primarily for the storage and/
or consolidation of manufactured goods (and to a lesser extent, raw materials) prior to their 
distribution to retail locations or other warehouses. A typical HCW has a high level of on-site 
automation and logistics management. The automation and logistics enable highly-efficient 
processing of goods through the HCW. A high-cube warehouse can be free-standing or located in 
an industrial park.
Warehousing (Land Use 150), high-cube transload and short-term storage warehouse (Land Use 
154), high-cube parcel hub warehouse (Land Use 156), and high-cube cold storage warehouse 
(Land Use 157) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
Each fulfillment center in the ITE database has been categorized as either a sort or non-sort 
facility. A sort facility is a fulfillment center that ships out smaller items, requiring extensive 
sorting, typically by manual means. A non-sort facility is a fulfillment center that ships large box 
items that are processed primarily with automation rather than through manual means. Separate 
sets of data plots are presented for the sort and non-sort fulfillment centers. Some limited 
assembly and repackaging may occur within the facility.
Additional Data
A high-cube warehouse may contain a mezzanine. In a HCW setting, a mezzanine is a free-
standing, semi-permanent structure that is commonly supported by structural steel columns 
and that is lined with racks or shelves. The gross floor area (GFA) values for the study sites in 
the database for this land use do NOT include the floor area of the mezzanine. The GFA values 
represent only the permanent ground-floor square footage.
The amount of office/employee welfare space that is provided within a HCW can be highly 
variable but is typically an insignificant portion of the overall building square footage. Within the 
trip generation database, common values are between 3,000 and 5,000 square feet for a Cold 
Storage HCW and between 5,000 and 10,000 square feet for Transload, Fulfillment Center, and 
Parcel Hub HCW (all of which are less than one percent of total GFA for a site). Therefore, for the 
trip generation data plots, any office space that is part of the normal operation of the warehouse 
is included in the total GFA.
The High-Cube Warehouse/Distribution Center-related land uses underwent specialized 
consideration through a commissioned study titled “High-Cube Warehouse Vehicle Trip Generation 
Analysis,” published in October 2016. The results of this study are posted on the ITE website at 
http://library.ite.org/pub/a3e6679a-e3a8-bf38-7f29-2961becdd498.

Description
A high-cube warehouse (HCW) is a building that typically has at least 200,000 gross square feet 
of floor area, has a ceiling height of 24 feet or more, and is used primarily for the storage and/
or consolidation of manufactured goods (and to a lesser extent, raw materials) prior to their

an industrial park.
A high-cube parcel hub warehouses typically serves as a regional and local freight-forwarder 
facility for time sensitive shipments via airfreight and ground carriers. A site can also include 
truck maintenance, wash, or fueling facilities. Some limited assembly and repackaging may occur 
within the facility.
A high-cube warehouse may contain a mezzanine. In a HCW setting, a mezzanine is a free-

The amount of office/employee welfare space that is provided within a HCW can be highly 
variable but is typically an insignificant portion of the overall building square footage. Within the 
trip generation database, common values are between 3,000 and 5,000 square feet for a Cold 
Storage HCW and between 5,000 and 10,000 square feet for Transload, Fulfillment Center, and 
Parcel Hub HCW (all of which are less than one percent of total GFA for a site). Therefore, for the 
trip generation data plots, any office space that is part of the normal operation of the warehouse 
is included in the total GFA.
Warehousing (Land Use 150), high-cube transload and short-term storage warehouse (Land 
Use 154), high-cube fulfillment center warehouse (Land Use 155), and high-cube cold storage 
warehouse (Land Use 157) are related land uses.
Additional Data
The High-Cube Warehouse/Distribution Center-related land uses underwent specialized 
consideration through a commissioned study titled “High-Cube Warehouse Vehicle Trip Generation 
Analysis,” published in October 2016. The results of this study are posted on the ITE website at 
http://library.ite.org/pub/a3e6679a-e3a8-bf38-7f29-2961becdd498.

High-Cube Cold Storage Warehouse
Description
A high-cube warehouse (HCW) is a building that typically has at least 200,000 gross square feet 
of floor area, has a ceiling height of 24 feet or more, and is used primarily for the storage and/
or consolidation of manufactured goods (and to a lesser extent, raw materials) prior to their 
distribution to retail locations or other warehouses. A typical HCW has a high level of on-site 
automation and logistics management. The automation and logistics enable highly-efficient 
processing of goods through the HCW. A high-cube warehouse can be free-standing or located in 
an industrial park.
A high-cube cold store warehouse has substantial temperature-controlled environments for frozen 
food and other perishable products.
A high-cube warehouse may contain a mezzanine. In a HCW setting, a mezzanine is a free-
standing, semi-permanent structure that is commonly supported by structural steel columns 
and that is lined with racks or shelves. The gross floor area (GFA) values for the study sites in 
the database for this land use do NOT include the floor area of the mezzanine. The GFA values 
represent only the permanent ground-floor square footage.
The amount of office/employee welfare space that is provided within a HCW can be highly 
variable but is typically an insignificant portion of the overall building square footage. Within the 
trip generation database, common values are between 3,000 and 5,000 square feet for a Cold 
Storage HCW and between 5,000 and 10,000 square feet for Transload, Fulfillment Center, and 
Parcel Hub HCW (all of which are less than one percent of total GFA for a site). Therefore, for the 
trip generation data plots, any office space that is part of the normal operation of the warehouse 
is included in the total GFA.
Warehousing (Land Use 150), high-cube transload and short-term storage warehouse (Land Use 
154), high-cube fulfillment center warehouse (Land Use 155), and high-cube parcel hub warehouse 
(Land Use 156) are related land uses.
Additional Data
The High-Cube Warehouse/Distribution Center-related land uses underwent specialized 
consideration through a commissioned study titled “High-Cube Warehouse Vehicle Trip Generation 
Analysis,” published in October 2016. The results of this study are posted on the ITE website at 
http://library.ite.org/pub/a3e6679a-e3a8-bf38-7f29-2961becdd498.
The sites were surveyed in the 2000s and the 2010s in California.

Data Center
Description
A data center is a free-standing warehouse type of facility that is primarily used for off-site 
storage of computer systems and associated components including applications and secure 
data. Some data centers may include maintenance areas and a small office. Data centers may be 
occupied by single or multiple tenants. Data centers typically have a small number of employees 
and visitors.
Additional Data
For the two data sites with time-of-day data, the AM and PM peak hours for the sites were 
between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m. and 3:00 and 4:00 p.m., respectively.
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in Illinois and Virginia.
Caution should be used when applying trip generation rates for data centers, as the database 
contains a small number of sites with limited data on the number of tenants and employees. To 
assist in the future analysis of this land use, it is important that this information be reported.

Single-Family Detached Housing
Description
A single-family detached housing site includes any single-family detached home on an individual 
lot. A typical site surveyed is a suburban subdivision.
Specialized Land Use
Data have been submitted for several single-family detached housing developments with homes that 
are commonly referred to as patio homes. A patio home is a detached housing unit that is located 
on a small lot with little (or no) front or back yard. In some subdivisions, communal maintenance 
of outside grounds is provided for the patio homes. The three patio home sites total 299 dwelling 
units with overall weighted average trip generation rates of 5.35 vehicle trips per dwelling unit for 
weekday, 0.26 for the AM adjacent street peak hour, and 0.47 for the PM adjacent street peak hour. 
These patio home rates based on a small sample of sites are lower than those for single-family 
detached housing (Land Use 210), lower than those for single-family attached housing (Land Use 
251), and higher than those for senior adult housing -- single-family (Land Use 251). Further analysis 
of this housing type will be conducted in a future edition of Trip Generation Manual.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
For 30 of the study sites, data on the number of residents and number of household vehicles are 
available. The overall averages for the 30 sites are 3.6 residents per dwelling unit and 1.5 vehicles 
per dwelling unit.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Arizona, California, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, 
New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Ontario (CAN), Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.

Single-Family Attached Housing
Description
Single-family attached housing includes any single-family housing unit that shares a wall with an 
adjoining dwelling unit, whether the walls are for living space, a vehicle garage, or storage space.
Additional Data
The database for this land use includes duplexes (defined as a single structure with two distinct 
dwelling units, typically joined side-by-side and each with at least one outside entrance) and 
townhouses/rowhouses (defined as a single structure with three or more distinct dwelling units, 
joined side-by-side in a row and each with an outside entrance).
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in British Columbia 
(CAN), California, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ontario 
(CAN), Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Multifamily Housing (Low-Rise)
Description
Low-rise multifamily housing includes apartments, townhouses, and condominiums located within 
the same building with at least three other dwelling units and that have two or three floors (levels). 
Various configurations fit this description, including walkup apartment, mansion apartment, and 
stacked townhouse.
•	 A walkup apartment typically is two or three floors in height with dwelling units that are accessed 
by a single or multiple entrances with stairways and hallways.
•	 A mansion apartment is a single structure that contains several apartments within what appears 
to be a single-family dwelling unit.
•	 A fourplex is a single two-story structure with two matching dwelling units on the ground and 
second floors. Access to the individual units is typically internal to the structure and provided 
through a central entry and stairway.
•	 A stacked townhouse is designed to match the external appearance of a townhouse. But, unlike 
a townhouse dwelling unit that only shares walls with an adjoining unit, the stacked townhouse 
units share both floors and walls. Access to the individual units is typically internal to the 
structure and provided through a central entry and stairway.
Multifamily housing (mid-rise) (Land Use 221), multifamily housing (high-rise) (Land Use 222), 
affordable housing (Land Use 223), and off-campus student apartment (low-rise) (Land Use 225) 
are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
Data are presented for two subcategories for this land use: (1) not close to rail transit and (2) 
close to rail transit. A site is considered close to rail transit if the walking distance between the 
residential site entrance and the closest rail transit station entrance is ½ mile or less.
Additional Data
For the three sites for which both the number of residents and the number of occupied dwelling 
units were available, there were an average of 2.72 residents per occupied dwelling unit.
For the two sites for which the numbers of both total dwelling units and occupied dwelling units 
were available, an average of 96.2 percent of the total dwelling units were occupied.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
252
Trip Generation Manual 11th Edition • Volume 3

generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
For the three sites for which data were provided for both occupied dwelling units and residents, 
there was an average of 2.72 residents per occupied dwelling unit.
It is expected that the number of bedrooms and number of residents are likely correlated to the 
trips generated by a residential site. To assist in future analysis, trip generation studies of all 
multifamily housing should attempt to obtain information on occupancy rate and on the mix of 
residential unit sizes (i.e., number of units by number of bedrooms at the site complex).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, the 2010s, and the 2020s in British 
Columbia (CAN), California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ontario (CAN), Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, 
South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Washington.

Land Use: 221
Multifamily Housing (Mid-Rise)
Description
Mid-rise multifamily housing includes apartments and condominiums located in a building that 
has between four and 10 floors of living space. Access to individual dwelling units is through an 
outside building entrance, a lobby, elevator, and a set of hallways.
Multifamily housing (low-rise) (Land Use 220), multifamily housing (high-rise) (Land Use 222), off-
campus student apartment (mid-rise) (Land Use 226), and mid-rise residential with ground-floor 
commercial (Land Use 231) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
Data are presented for two subcategories for this land use: (1) not close to rail transit and (2) 
close to rail transit. A site is considered close to rail transit if the walking distance between the 
residential site entrance and the closest rail transit station entrance is ½ mile or less.
Additional Data
For the six sites for which both the number of residents and the number of occupied dwelling 
units were available, there were an average of 2.5 residents per occupied dwelling unit.
For the five sites for which the numbers of both total dwelling units and occupied dwelling units 
were available, an average of 96 percent of the total dwelling units were occupied.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
It is expected that the number of bedrooms and number of residents are likely correlated to the 
trips generated by a residential site. To assist in future analysis, trip generation studies of all 
multifamily housing should attempt to obtain information on occupancy rate and on the mix of 
residential unit sizes (i.e., number of units by number of bedrooms at the site complex).
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s, the 2000s, the 2010s, and the 2020s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, 
Montana, New Jersey, New York, Ontario (CAN), Oregon, Utah, and Virginia.

Land Use: 222
Multifamily Housing (High-Rise)
Description
High-rise multifamily housing includes apartments, townhouses, and condominiums. Each 
building has more than 10 floors of living space. Access to individual dwelling units is through an 
outside building entrance, a lobby, elevators, and a set of hallways.
Multifamily housing (low-rise) (Land Use 220), multifamily housing (mid-rise) (Land Use 221), off-
campus student apartment (high-rise) (Land Use 227), and high-rise residential with ground-floor 
commercial (Land Use 232) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
Data are presented for two subcategories for this land use: (1) not close to rail transit and (2) 
close to rail transit. A site is considered close to rail transit if the walking distance between the 
residential site entrance and the closest rail transit station entrance is ½ mile or less.
Additional Data
For the 12 sites for which both the number of residents and the number of occupied dwelling units 
were available, there were an average of 1.6 residents per occupied dwelling unit.
For the 26 sites for which the numbers of both total dwelling units and occupied dwelling units 
were available, an average of 98 percent of the total dwelling units were occupied.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this land use. 
The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip generation resource 
page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-and-parking-generation/).
For the 12 sites for which data were provided for both occupied dwelling units and residents, there 
was an average of 1.6 residents per occupied dwelling unit.
For the 26 sites for which data were provided for both occupied dwelling units and total dwelling 
units, an average of 98 percent of the units were occupied.
It is expected that the number of bedrooms and number of residents are likely correlated to the 
trips generated by a residential site. To assist in future analysis, trip generation studies of all 
multifamily housing should attempt to obtain information on occupancy rate and on the mix of 
residential unit sizes (i.e., number of units by number of bedrooms at the site complex).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, District of Columbia, 
Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ontario (CAN), Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.

Land Use: 223
Affordable Housing
Description
Affordable housing includes all multifamily housing that is rented at below market rate to 
households that include at least one employed member. Eligibility to live in affordable housing can 
be a function of limited household income and resident age. Multifamily housing (low-rise) (Land 
Use 220), multifamily housing (mid-rise) (Land Use 221), and multifamily housing (high-rise) (Land 
Use 222) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
Data are presented for three subcategories for this land use: (1) sites with income limitations 
for its tenants (denoted as income limits in the data plots), (2) sites with both minimum age 
thresholds and income limitations for its tenants (denoted as senior in the data plots), and (3) 
sites designed for and occupied by residents with special needs, such as persons with physical 
and mental impairments, single mothers, recovering addicts and others living in a group setting.
Additional Data
For most study sites contained in this land use, all dwelling units in the development are classified 
as affordable units. For residential study sites that provide a mix of market value and affordable 
units, the study sites with at least 75 percent of the dwelling units designated as affordable are 
also included in this land use database.
It is expected that the number of bedrooms and number of residents are likely correlated to the 
trips generated by a residential site. To assist in future analysis, trip generation studies of all 
multifamily housing should attempt to obtain information on occupancy rate and on the mix of 
residential unit sizes (i.e., number of units by number of bedrooms at the site complex).

Land Use: 225
Off-Campus Student Apartment (Low-Rise)
Description
An off-campus student apartment (low-rise) complex houses college or university students in 
structures with two or three floors of living space. The apartments are typically rented by the 
bedroom and most contain a common area or shared living space (living room, kitchen, dining 
area). Each bedroom typically has a private bath. These apartments are sometimes called 
independent bedroom apartments.
The dwelling unit typically ranges in size between a studio apartment and a five-bedroom 
apartment. It can be rented furnished or unfurnished. It is common for each apartment to have a 
washer and dryer.
The property is typically located near or within walking distance of a college campus and provides 
student-related amenities such as free high-speed Internet, a study lounge, fitness center, sports 
court, and swimming pool. An off-campus student apartment complex typically provides security 
and 24-hour emergency maintenance.
Multifamily housing (low-rise) (Land Use 220), off-campus student apartment (mid-rise) (Land Use 
226), and off-campus student apartment (high-rise) (Land Use 227) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
The data included in this land use have been stratified into two subcategories: (1) sites located 
adjacent to campus and (2) sites located over a half mile from campus. For some of the latter 
sites, regular shuttle service is provided to and from the campus.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Minnesota, Montana, 
and South Carolina.

Off-Campus Student Apartment (Mid-Rise)
Description
An off-campus student apartment (mid-rise) complex houses college or university students in 
structures with between four and 10 floors of living space. The apartments are typically rented 
by the bedroom and most contain a common area or shared living space (living room, kitchen, 
dining area). Each bedroom typically has a private bath. These apartments are sometimes called 
independent bedroom apartments.
The dwelling unit typically ranges in size between a studio apartment and a five-bedroom 
apartment. It can be rented furnished or unfurnished. It is common for each apartment to have a 
washer and dryer.
The property is typically located near or within walking distance of a college campus and provides 
student-related amenities such as free high-speed Internet, a study lounge, fitness center, sports 
court, and swimming pool. An off-campus student apartment complex typically provides security 
and 24-hour emergency maintenance.
Multifamily housing (mid-rise) (Land Use 221), off-campus student apartment (low-rise) (Land Use 
225), and off-campus student apartment (high-rise) (Land Use 227) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
The data included in this land use have been stratified into two subcategories: (1) sites located 
adjacent to campus and (2) sites located over a half mile from campus. For some of the latter 
sites, regular shuttle service is provided to and from the campus.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in Arizona, California, Florida, and Minnesota.

Low-Rise Residential with Ground-Floor Commercial
Description
Low-rise residential with ground-floor commercial is a mixed-use multifamily housing building 
with two or three floors of residential living space and commercial space open to the public on 
the ground level. These facilities are typically found in dense multi-use urban and center city core 
settings. Multifamily housing (low-rise) (Land Use 220), mid-rise residential with ground floor 
commercial (Land Use 231), and high-rise residential with ground-floor commercial (Land Use 
232) are related land uses.
Land Use Subcategory
The data included in this land use have been stratified into two subcategories: (1) sites with a 
commercial gross leasable area that ranges between 1,000 and 25,000 square feet (2) sites with a 
commercial gross leasable area that ranges between 25,000 and 65,000 square feet.
Additional Data
The trips displayed in the data plots represent the total trips that enter or exit the site. Any trips 
internal to the site between its residential and commercial components are not included.
The ITE Trip Generation Handbook (TGH) presents an alternative approach for estimating trips 
generated by a site that fits this land use. The TGH method involves the estimation of the internal 
trip-making at a mixed-use site.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-

Senior Adult Housing—Single-Family
Description
Senior adult housing—single-family sites are independent living developments that are called 
various names including retirement communities, age-restricted housing, and active adult 
communities. The development has a specific age restriction for its residents, typically a 
minimum of 55 years of age for at least one resident of the household.
Residents in these communities are typically considered active and requiring little to no medical 
supervision. The percentage of retired residents varies by development. The development may 
include amenities such as a golf course, swimming pool, 24-hour security, transportation, and 
common recreational facilities. They generally lack centralized dining and on-site health facilities.
The dwelling units can be either detached or attached. The types of housing types represented by 
sites in the database include traditional single-family detached homes, patio homes, duplexes, and 
townhouses. Single-family attached housing includes any single-family housing unit that shares 
a wall with an adjoining dwelling unit, whether the walls are for living space, a vehicle garage, or 
storage space.
Senior adult housing—multifamily (Land Use 252), congregate care facility (Land Use 253), 
assisted living (Land Use 254), and continuing care retirement community (Land Use 255) are 
related land uses.
Additional Data
Caution should be used when applying trip rates for this land use as it may contain a wide variety 
of studies ranging from communities with very active, working residents to communities with 
older, retired residents. As more data become available, consideration will be given to future 
stratification of this land use.
Many factors affected the trip rates for detached senior adult housing. Factors such as the 
average age of residents, development location and size, affluence of residents, employment 
status, and vehicular access should be taken into consideration when conducting an analysis. 
Some developments were located within close proximity to medical facilities, restaurants, 
shopping centers, banks, and recreational activities.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
For the six sites for which data were provided for both occupied dwelling units and total dwelling 
units, an average of 98 percent of the units were occupied.

Senior Adult Housing—Multifamily
Description
Senior adult housing–multifamily sites are independent living developments that are called 
various names including retirement communities, age-restricted housing, and active adult 
communities. The development has a specific age restriction for its residents, typically a 
minimum of 55 years of age for at least one resident of the household.
Residents in these communities are typically considered active and requiring little to no medical 
supervision. The percentage of retired residents varies by development. The development may 
include amenities such as a golf course, swimming pool, 24-hour security, transportation, and 
common recreational facilities. They generally lack centralized dining and on-site health facilities.
The dwelling units share both floors and walls with other units in the residential building. Senior 
adult housing—single-family (Land Use 251), congregate care facility (Land Use 253), assisted 
living (Land Use 254), and continuing care retirement community (Land Use 255) are related land 
uses.

land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-

The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2000s in Alberta (CAN), California, 
Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ontario (CAN), and Pennsylvania.

Congregate Care Facility
Description
A congregate care facility is an independent living development that provides centralized 
amenities such as dining, housekeeping, communal transportation, and organized social/
recreational activities. Each individual dwelling unit often has a kitchenette. Assistance is typically 
available for housekeeping or minor household maintenance. Limited medical services (such as 
nursing and dental) may or may not be provided. The resident may contract additional medical 
services or personal assistance. Senior adult housing—single-family (Land Use 251), senior 
adult housing—multifamily (Land Use 252), assisted living (Land Use 254), and continuing care 
retirement community (Land Use 255) are related uses.
Additional Data
Resident vehicle ownership levels are very low at a congregate care facility. The majority of site-
generated trips are made by facility employees, contracted services, and visitors.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
Minnesota, Ontario (CAN), and Oregon.

Assisted Living
Description
An assisted living complex is a residential setting that provides either routine general protective 
oversight or assistance with activities necessary for independent living to persons with mental or 
physical limitations. The typical resident has difficulty managing in an independent living arrangement 
but does not require nursing home care. Its centralized services typically include dining, housekeeping, 
social and physical activities, medication administration, and communal transportation.
The complex commonly provides separate living quarters for each resident. Alzheimer’s and ALS 
care are commonly offered at an assisted living facility. Living quarters for these patients may be 
located separately from the other residents.
Assisted care commonly bridges the gap between independent living and a nursing home. In some 
areas of the country, an assisted living residence may be called personal care, residential care, or 
domiciliary care. Staff may be available at an assisted care facility 24 hours a day, but skilled medical 
care—which is limited in nature—is not required. Congregate care facility (Land Use 253), continuing 
care retirement community (Land Use 255), and nursing home (Land Use 620) are related uses.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Connecticut, New 
Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah.

Land Use: 255
Continuing Care Retirement Community
Description
A continuing care retirement community (CCRC) is a land use that provides multiple elements 
of senior adult living. A CCRC enables a resident to transition in place from independent living 
to increased care as the medical needs of the resident change. Housing options may include 
various combinations of senior adult housing (both single-family and multifamily), congregate 
care, assisted living, and nursing home. The community may also contain special services such 
as medical, dining, recreational, communal transportation, and some limited, supporting retail 
facilities. A CCRC is usually a self-contained village. Senior adult housing—single-family (Land Use 
251), senior adult housing—multifamily (Land Use 252), congregate care facility (Land Use 253), 
assisted living (Land Use 254), and nursing home (Land Use 620) are related uses. 
Additional Data
Caution should be used when applying these data. CCRC developments consist of various 
housing components (dwelling units, rooms, and beds) that often exist in varying proportions. 
Therefore, the use of a single housing component may not fully represent the trip generation 
characteristics of these communities. The comprehensive independent variable—units—is the 
descriptor used in the data plots. This variable represents an aggregate of dwelling units for 
the single-family and congregate components of the CCRC and the beds in the assisted living 
component. To illustrate the varying proportions of housing options that exist in the database, 
the following table describes the residential units for nine of the CCRCs in the database.

A complete study of CCRCs requires future analysis of their various components. Therefore, it 
is important to collect as much information as possible. At the very least, the total number of 
456

dwelling units, rooms, and beds should be obtained; if possible, the number of corresponding 
occupied units should be recorded as well.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Connecticut, Illinois, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Ontario (CAN), Pennsylvania, and Virginia.

Description
A recreational home is either (1) a second home used by its owner periodically for recreation 
or (2) rented on a seasonal basis. Some sites in the database are located within a resort that 
contains local services and complete recreational facilities. Timeshare (Land Use 265) is a related 
land use.
Additional Data
A large number of internal trips are made for recreational purposes in resort communities 
containing recreational homes.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, New York, 
and Oregon.

Description
A timeshare is a development where multiple purchasers buy interests in the same property and 
each purchaser receives the right to use the facility for a period of time each year. The shared 
property is commonly a vacation or recreational condominium. Recreational homes (Land Use 
260) is a related land use.
Additional Data
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s and the 2000s in California and South Carolina.

Residential Planned Unit Development
Description
A residential planned unit development (PUD), for the purposes of trip generation, is defined as 
containing any combination of residential land uses. These developments might also contain 
supporting services such as limited retail and recreational facilities.
Additional Data
Caution—The description of a PUD is general in nature because these developments vary by 
density and type of dwelling. It is therefore recommended that when information on the number 
and type of dwellings is known, trip generation should be calculated on the basis of the known 
type of dwellings rather than on the basis of Land Use 270. Data for this land use are provided as 
general information and would be applicable only when the number of dwellings is known.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, and the 1990s, and the 2000s in Minnesota, South Dakota, 
and Virginia.

Hotel
Description
A hotel is a place of lodging that provides sleeping accommodations and supporting facilities 
such as a full-service restaurant, cocktail lounge, meeting rooms, banquet room, and convention 
facilities. A hotel typically provides a swimming pool or another recreational facility such as a 
fitness room. All suites hotel (Land Use 311), business hotel (Land Use 312), motel (Land Use 
320), and resort hotel (Land Use 330) are related uses.
Additional Data
Twenty-five studies provided information on occupancy rates at the time the studies were 
conducted. The average occupancy rate for these studies was approximately 82 percent.
Some properties in this land use provide guest transportation services (e.g., airport shuttle, 
limousine service, golf course shuttle service) which may have an impact on the overall trip 
generation rates.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, District 
of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Minnesota, New York, Ontario (CAN), Pennsylvania, South 
Dakota, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.
For all lodging uses, it is important to collect data on occupied rooms as well as total rooms in 
order to accurately predict trip generation characteristics for the site.
Trip generation at a hotel may be related to the presence of supporting facilities such as 
convention facilities, restaurants, meeting/banquet space, and retail facilities. Future data 
submissions should specify the presence of these amenities. Reporting the level of activity 
at the supporting facilities such as full, empty, partially active, number of people attending a 
meeting/banquet during observation may also be useful in further analysis of this land use.

Land Use: 311
All Suites Hotel
Description
An all suites hotel is a place of lodging that provides sleeping accommodations, a small 
restaurant and lounge, and small amounts of meeting space. Each suite includes a sitting room 
and separate bedroom. An in-room kitchen is often provided. Hotel (Land Use 310), business hotel 
(Land Use 312), motel (Land Use 320), and resort hotel (Land Use 330) are related uses.
Additional Data
Six studies provided information on occupancy rates at the time the studies were conducted. The 
average occupancy rate for these studies was approximately 74 percent.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2010s in Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, 
Montana, Virginia, and Washington.
For all lodging uses, it is important to collect data on occupied rooms as well as total rooms in 
order to accurately predict trip generation characteristics for the site.

Business Hotel
Description
A business hotel is a place of lodging aimed toward the business traveler but also accommodates 
a growing number of recreational travelers. These hotels provide sleeping accommodations and 
other limited facilities, such as a breakfast buffet bar and afternoon beverage bar. Some provide a 
full-service restaurant geared toward hotel guests. Some provide a swimming pool; most provide 
fitness facilities. Limited space for meeting facilities may be provided. Each unit is a large single 
room. Hotel (Land Use 310), all suites hotel (Land Use 311), motel (Land Use 320), and resort 
hotel (Land Use 330) are related uses.
Additional Data
Ten studies provided information on room occupancy at the time of data collection. The average 
occupancy rate for these sites was approximately 86 percent.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The average numbers of person trips per vehicle trip at the three general urban/suburban sites at 
which both person trip and vehicle trip data were collected, were as follows:
•	 1.3 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 7 and 9 a.m.
•	 1.3 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 4 and 6 p.m.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2010s in the District of Columbia, 
Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Minnesota, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
For all lodging uses, it is important to collect data on occupied rooms as well as total rooms in 
order to accurately predict trip generation characteristics for the site.

Motel
Description
A motel is a place of lodging that provides sleeping accommodations and provides little or no 
meeting space and few supporting facilities. Exterior corridors accessing rooms (immediately 
adjacent to a parking lot) is common for a motel. Hotel (Land Use 310), all suites hotel (Land Use 
311), business hotel (Land Use 312), and resort hotel (Land Use 330) are related uses.
Additional Data
Sixteen studies provided information on occupancy rates at the time the studies were conducted. 
The average occupancy rate for these studies was approximately 82 percent.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, Florida, 
Indiana, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, South Dakota, and Texas.
For all lodging uses, it is important to collect data on occupied rooms as well as total rooms in 
order to accurately predict trip generation characteristics for the site.

Land Use: 330
Resort Hotel
Description
A resort hotel is similar to a hotel (Land Use 310) in that it provides sleeping accommodations, 
full-service restaurants, cocktail lounges, retail shops, and guest services. The primary difference 
is that a resort hotel caters to the tourist and vacation industry, often providing a wide variety 
of recreational facilities/programs (e.g., golf courses, tennis courts, beach access, or other 
amenities) rather than convention and meeting business. Hotel (Land Use 310), all suites hotel 
(Land Use 311), business hotel (Land Use 312), and motel (Land Use 320) are related uses.
Additional Data
It is recognized that some resort hotels cater to convention business as well as the tourist and 
vacation industry. The sites in the database do not have convention facilities. A resort hotel 
with convention facilities is likely to have a different level and pattern of trip generation than is 
presented in the data plots.
Nine studies provided information on room occupancy at the time of data collection. The average 
occupancy rate for these sites was approximately 88 percent.
Some properties in this land use provide guest transportation services (e.g., airport shuttle, 
limousine service, golf course shuttle service) which may have an impact on the overall trip 
generation rates.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s and the 1990s in California, Florida, and South Carolina.
For all lodging uses, it is important to collect data on occupied rooms as well as total rooms in 
order to accurately predict trip generation characteristics for the site.

Trip Generation Manual, 11th Edition (TGM) is a publication of the Institute of Transportation 
Engineers (ITE). TGM is an educational tool for planners, transportation professionals, zoning boards, 
and others who are interested in estimating trip generation at a proposed development.
TGM includes a complete set of searchable electronic files including land use descriptions and 
data plots for all available combinations of land uses, time periods, independent variables, and 
settings. Data contained in TGM are presented for informational purposes only and do not include 
ITE recommendations on the best course of action or the preferred application of the data. The 
information is based on trip generation studies submitted voluntarily to ITE by public agencies, 
developers, consulting firms, student chapters, and associations.
TGM provides access for users to the ITETripGen web app. This desktop application allows electronic 
access to the entire trip generation dataset with numerous filtering capabilities including site setting 
(i.e., rural, general urban/suburban, dense multi-use urban, center city core), geographic location, age 
of data, and development size. Instructions for using ITETripGen are included within the app.
Additional data are needed from the profession to create a data-rich environment for trip generation 
analysis. ITE will continue to prepare updates to TGM.
User comments on TGM are invited. ITE continually seeks ways to increase the value of this document 
and requests that users provide recently collected data for the land uses presented in TGM or any 
other land uses for inclusion in future editions and updates.
Although this report provides a powerful tool to better understand site-generated vehicle and person 
trips, it contains information that can also be easily misinterpreted without sound professional 
judgment. Users are cautioned to use professional judgment in applying all data contained in this 
report. They also need to be cognizant of site and area characteristics that can affect trip generation 
(e.g., availability of transit services, demand management strategies, parking pricing) and of the 
continued need for additional data. Lack of appreciation of these factors may lead to an inaccurate 
estimate of vehicle and person trip generation and ultimately the improper design of person and 
vehicle site access.

Land Use: 411
Public Park
Description
A public park is owned and operated by a municipal, county, state, or federal agency. The parks 
surveyed vary widely as to location, type, and number of facilities, including boating or swimming 
facilities, beaches, hiking trails, ball fields, soccer fields, campsites, and picnic facilities. Seasonal 
use of the individual sites differs widely as a result of the varying facilities and local conditions, 
such as weather. For example, some of the sites are used primarily for boating or swimming; 
others are used for softball games. Soccer complex (Land Use 488) is a related use.
Additional Data
The percentage of the park area that is used most intensively varies considerably within the 
studies contained in this land use. Therefore, caution should be used when using acres as an 
independent variable.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Arizona, California, 
New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and Oregon.

Movie Theater
Description
A movie theater is a place where movies are screened for public entertainment. A theater includes 
a lobby, refreshment area, and audience seating for each movie screen. Amenities such as 
reclining seats, tiered stadium seating, and assigned seating are sometimes offered. A theater 
can be stand-alone or part of a larger retail complex.
Additional Data
Caution should be used when applying these data, as the peaking characteristics for this land 
use can have a significant impact on trip generation rates. Peaking at movie theaters typically 
occur in time periods shorter than an hour. The start and end times for a movie theater may be 
staggered to reduce peak surging impacts.
For 25 sites with data for both number of movie screens and number of seats, the average number 
of seats per movie screen was 236 (with values ranging between 150 and 336). The database 
includes two exceptions, both theaters with three movie screens and with an average of 740 seats 
per movie screen.
The peak hour of the generator for movie theaters occurred on Friday and Saturday evenings 
between 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, Connecticut, 
Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, 
Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Ice Skating Rink
Description
An ice-skating rink is a stand-alone facility used for ice-skating-oriented sports and entertainment 
activities. It may contain limited spectator seating, refreshment areas, a locker room, and arcade.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, New Jersey, and Utah.

Casino
Description
A casino is a facility that exists for the primary purpose of deriving revenue from gaming 
operations. The games conducted at these facilities include but are not limited to table games, 
electronic slot machines, video poker and lottery games, and electronic table games.
All study sites are free-standing and isolated from other complementary or competitive 
development. Most of the casinos in the land use are physically connected to a hotel. A small 
number of video lottery establishments are also included in this land use. These facilities have 
less than 5,000 square feet gross floor area and are not connected to a hotel.
This land use does not include facilities located on a resort-corridor facility such as the “Strip” in 
Las Vegas, Nevada.  Resort-corridor facilities experience significant non-vehicle trip sharing due 
to pedestrian walking trips or public transportation services resulting from the synergy created by 
the close proximity of the hotel/casinos.  It is anticipated the resort-corridor casinos would exhibit 
trip generation characteristics distinct from those included in this land use.
Bingo hall (Land Use 470) is a related use.
Additional Data
The reported trips generated by a casino include all trips entering and exiting the overall site. For 
the free-standing casino/hotels, the assumption is that the vast majority of site-generated trips 
are directly related to the casino.
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s, 2000s, and the 2010s in Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and South Dakota.

Water Slide Park
Description
A water slide park contains water slides, wading pools, and refreshment stands. Some water slide 
parks may include picnic areas.
Additional Data
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s and the 1990s in Idaho, New Hampshire, and Oklahoma.
Specialized Land Use Data
A 2011 study provided data on three indoor water slide parks with attached lodging in 
Pennsylvania and Ohio. The number of rooms in the attached hotels varied between 200 and 
395. The gross floor area ranged between 50,000 and 80,000 square feet, with an average of 
63,000. The number of parking spaces ranged between 472 and 790 with an average of 580. The 
information collected for these sites is presented below.
The following weighted average vehicle trip generation rates were observed:
•	 0.21 per parking space or 1.92 per 1,000 square feet gross floor area during the weekday, PM 
peak hour of adjacent street traffic
•	 0.10 per parking space or 0.89 per 1,000 square feet gross floor area during the weekday, AM 
peak hour of the generator
•	 0.23 per parking space or 2.03 per 1,000 square feet gross floor area during the weekday, PM 
peak hour of the generator
•	 0.39 per parking space or 3.58 per 1,000 square feet gross floor area during the Saturday, peak 
hour of the generator
•	 0.33 per parking space or 3.01 per 1,000 square feet gross floor area during the Sunday, peak 
hour of the generator

Soccer Complex
Description
A soccer complex is an outdoor facility that is used for non-professional soccer games. It may 
consist of multiple fields. The size of each field within the land use may vary to accommodate 
games for different age groups. On-site amenities may include stadium seating, a fitness trail, an 
activities shelter, aquatic center, picnic grounds, basketball and tennis courts, and a playground. 
Public park (Land Use 411) is a related use.
Additional Data
Caution should be used when applying these data. Peaking at soccer complexes typically 
occurred in time periods shorter than 1 hour. These peaking periods may have durations of 10 
to 15 minutes. To assist in the future analysis of this land use, it is important to collect driveway 
counts in 10-minute intervals.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s and the 2010s in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Indiana, New 
Jersey, and Washington.

Elementary School
Description
An elementary school is a public school that typically serves students attending kindergarten 
through the fifth or sixth grade. An elementary school is usually centrally located in a residential 
community to facilitate student access. Bus service is commonly provided to students living 
beyond a specified distance from the school. Middle school/junior high school (Land Use 522), 
private school (K-8) (Land Use 530), private school (K-12) (Land Use 532), charter elementary 
school (Land Use 536), and charter school (K-12) (Land Use 538) are related uses.
Additional Data
Elementary school students generally used school buses more than regular transit and were 
dropped off and picked up more than high school students, who were apt to walk longer 
distances, ride bicycles, or, in some cases, drive to school. The percentage of students at the sites 
who were transported to school via bus varied considerably. Some sites experienced higher than 
average trip rates because many students did not utilize the available school bus service. Due 
to the varied transit and school bus usage at these sites, it is desirable that future studies report 
additional detail on the percentage of students who were bused to school and the percentage that 
were dropped off and picked up.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alabama, Arizona, 
British Columbia (CAN), California, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, 
New York, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washinton, and West Virginia.

High School
Description
A high school is a public school that serves students who have completed middle or junior high 
school. Middle school/junior high school (Land Use 522), private school (K-12) (Land Use 532), 
private high school (Land Use (534), and charter school (K-12) (Land Use 538) are related uses.
Additional Data
The trip generation for weekend time periods varied considerably; therefore, caution should 
be used when applying weekend statistics. Information describing the weekend activities 
conducted at the high schools was not available.
The percentage of students at the sites who were transported to school via bus varied 
considerably. Due to the varied transit and school bus usage at these sites, it is desirable that 
future studies include additional detail on the percentage of students who were bused to school 
and the percentage who were dropped off and picked up.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, 
Oregon, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia.

School District Office
Description
A school district office is an administrative office building that provides services and support to 
parents, students, and the community. A school district office typically offers centralized services 
for multiple schools in a district including staff training, purchasing, technology services, strategic 
planning, public information, student transportation, and student assessments.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in Texas.

Land Use: 540
Junior/Community College
Description
This land use includes 2-year junior, community, and technical colleges. A junior/community 
college may have a sizeable evening program. University/college (Land Use 550) is a related use.
Additional Data
The trip generation for weekend time periods varies considerably between study sites. Caution 
should be used when applying weekend statistics. Information describing the weekend activities 
conducted at junior/community colleges was not available.
To assist in future analysis of this land use, it is important to specify if transit service is 
available within close proximity to the site.
Acreage, floor space, staff, and parking accommodations vary widely with the populations served 
and the social and economic characteristics of the area. The number of students may be the most 
reliable independent variable on which to establish a trip generation estimate.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), Kansas, New 
Mexico, and Texas.

Land Use: 550
University/College
Description
This land use includes 4-year universities or colleges that may or may not offer graduate 
programs. Junior/community college (Land Use 540) and off-campus student apartment (Land 
Uses 225, 226, 227) are related land uses.
Additional Data
The trip generation for weekend time periods varied considerably; therefore, caution should 
be used when applying weekend statistics. Information describing the weekend activities 
conducted at universities/colleges was not available.
To assist in future analysis of this land use, it is important to specify if transit service was 
available within close proximity to the site.
Acreage, floor space, staff, and parking accommodations varied widely with the populations 
served and the social and economic characteristics of the area; thus, the number of students may 
be a more reliable independent variable on which to establish trip generation rates.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Oregon, Utah, and Washington.

Description
A church is a building in which public worship services are held. A church houses an assembly hall 
or sanctuary. It may also house meeting rooms, classrooms, and, occasionally, dining, catering, or 
event facilities. Synagogue (Land Use 561) and mosque (Land Use 562) are related uses.
Additional Data
Worship services are typically held on Sundays. Some of the surveyed churches offered day care 
or extended care programs during the week.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Colorado, Florida, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, 
and Virginia.

Description
A synagogue is a building in which public worship services are held. A synagogue may also house 
a sanctuary, meeting rooms, classrooms and, occasionally, dining, catering, or event facilities. 
Church (Land Use 560) and mosque (Land Use 562) are related uses.
Additional Data
One study reported trip counts taken during the Yom Kippur holiday (source 571). The 
30,000-square foot site had 20 employees and 1,040 family members. The numbers of vehicle 
trips are presented below and are excluded from the data plots:
•	 446 during the weekday, AM peak hour of adjacent street traffic
•	 308 during the weekday, PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic
•	 871 during the weekday, AM peak hour of the generator
•	 772 during the weekday, PM peak hour of the generator
The sites were surveyed in the 2000s and the 2010s in New York and Pennsylvania.

Adult Detention Facility
Description
An adult detention facility is a facility in which a person is confined either for a short-term stay 
while awaiting trial (in a jail) or for a long-term stay while serving a sentence resulting from a 
conviction (in a prison). An adult detention facility usually consists of cells, dining and food 
preparation facilities, limited recreational facilities, work areas, and offices.
The data for jails and prisons were evaluated separately and together. There are no significant 
differences in the trip generation rates; therefore, the data are presented in combination in the 
data plots included for this land use. The potential for distinct rates for jails and prisons will 
continue to be investigated as new data are submitted.
The prison study sites in the database are either minimum- or medium-security prisons. No 
maximum-security facilities are included.
Additional Data
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s and the 2000s in Connecticut, Florida, Oregon, and West Virginia.

Hospital
Description
A hospital is any institution where medical or surgical care and overnight accommodations are 
provided to non-ambulatory and ambulatory patients. In this context, the term “hospital” does not 
refer to a medical clinic (a facility that provides diagnoses and outpatient care only) or a nursing 
home (a facility devoted to the care of persons unable to care for themselves), which are covered 
elsewhere in this report. Clinic (Land Use 630) and free-standing emergency room (Land Use 650) 
are related uses.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The average numbers of person trips per vehicle trip at the four general urban/suburban sites at 
which both person trip and vehicle trip data were collected were as follows:
•	 1.6 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 7 and 9 a.m.
•	 1.6 during Weekday, AM Peak Hour of Generator
•	 1.7 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 4 and 6 p.m.
•	 1.7 during Weekday, PM Peak Hour of Generator
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington.

Nursing Home
Description
A nursing home is a facility whose primary function is to provide care for persons who are unable 
to care for themselves. Examples include rest homes, chronic care, and convalescent homes. 
Skilled nurses and nursing aides are present 24 hours a day at these sites. Residents often require 
treatment from a registered healthcare professional for ongoing medical issues. A nursing home 
resident is not capable of operating a vehicle. Traffic is entirely generated by employees, visitors, 
and deliveries. Assisted living (Land Use 254) and continuing care retirement community (Land 
Use 255) are related uses.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The average numbers of person trips per vehicle trip at the three general urban/suburban sites at 
which both person trip and vehicle trip data were collected were as follows:
•	 1.0 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 7 and 9 a.m.
•	 1.1 during Weekday, AM Peak Hour of Generator
•	 1.5 during Weekday, PM Peak Hour of Generator
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
Florida, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ontario, Canada, and Texas.

Clinic
Description
A clinic is a facility that provides limited diagnostic and outpatient care but is unable to provide 
prolonged in-house medical and surgical care. A clinic may have a lab facility and supporting 
pharmacy but typically does not have the equipment and medical personnel available at an urgent 
care site. A clinic typically offers a wide range of services which makes it distinct from a medical 
office building that typically houses specialized or individual physicians. Hospital (Land Use 610), 
free-standing emergency room (Land Use 650), and medical-dental office building (Land Use 720) 
are related uses.
Specialized Land Use
Data collected at a single methadone clinic in New Hampshire in 2021 indicate the likelihood of 
different trip generation rates than for a general medical clinic. The site gross floor area is 4,300 
square feet. The vehicle trip counts are as follows:
•	 Weekday—283
•	 Weekday, AM peak hour of adjacent street—39
•	 Weekday, AM peak hour of generator—45
•	 Weekday, PM peak hour of adjacent street—1
•	 Saturday—189
•	 Saturday, peak hour of generator—64
•	 Sunday—167
•	 Sunday, peak hour of generator—56
The methadone clinic generates significantly more trips than a clinic during the morning peak 
periods and significantly fewer trips during the afternoon adjacent street peak period.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).

The average numbers of person trips per vehicle trip at the five general urban/suburban sites at 
which both person trip and vehicle trip data were collected were as follows:
•	 1.4 during Weekday, AM Peak Hour of Generator
•	 1.7 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 4 and 6 p.m.
•	 1.5 during Weekday, PM Peak Hour of Generator
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Texas, Vermont, and West Virginia.

organizations, or professional persons or firms are conducted. An office building houses multiple 
tenants that can include, as examples, professional services, insurance companies, investment 
brokers, a banking institution, a restaurant, or other service retailers. A general office building 
with a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet or less is classified as a small office building (Land 
Use 712). Corporate headquarters building (Land Use 714), single tenant office building (Land 
Use 715), medical-dental office building (Land Use 720), office park (Land Use 750), research and 
development center (Land Use 760), and business park (Land Use 770) are additional related uses.
Additional Data
If two or more general office buildings are in close physical proximity (within a close walk) and 
function as a unit (perhaps with a shared parking facility and common or complementary tenants), 
the total gross floor area or employment of the paired office buildings can be used for calculating 
the site trip generation. If the individual buildings are isolated or not functionally related to one 
another, trip generation should be calculated for each building separately.
For study sites with reported gross floor area and employees, an average employee density of 
3.3 employees per 1,000 square feet GFA (or roughly 300 square feet per employee) has been 
consistent through the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. No sites counted in the 2010s reported both GFA 
and employees.
The average building occupancy varies considerably within the studies for which occupancy data 
were provided. The reported occupied gross floor area was 88 percent for general urban/suburban 
sites and 96 percent for the center city core and dense multi-use urban sites.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The average numbers of person trips per vehicle trip at the eight center city core sites at which 
both person trip and vehicle trip data were collected are as follows:
•	 2.8 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 7 and 9 a.m.
•	 2.9 during Weekday, AM Peak Hour of Generator
•	 2.9 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 4 and 6 p.m.
•	 3.0 during Weekday, PM Peak Hour of Generator
General Urban/Suburban and Rural (Land Uses 400–799)

The average numbers of person trips per vehicle trip at the 18 dense multi-use urban sites at 
which both person trip and vehicle trip data were collected are as follows:
•	 1.5 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 7 and 9 a.m.
•	 1.5 during Weekday, AM Peak Hour of Generator
•	 1.5 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 4 and 6 p.m.
•	 1.5 during Weekday, PM Peak Hour of Generator
The average numbers of person trips per vehicle trip at the 23 general urban/suburban sites at 
which both person trip and vehicle trip data were collected are as follows:
•	 1.3 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 7 and 9 a.m.
•	 1.3 during Weekday, AM Peak Hour of Generator
•	 1.3 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 4 and 6 p.m.
•	 1.4 during Weekday, PM Peak Hour of Generator
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, the 2010s, and the 2020s in Alberta 
(CAN), California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, 
Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, 
Ontario (CAN)Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington.

Small Office Building
Description
A small office building is the same as a general office building (Land Use 710) but with less than 
or equal to 10,000 square feet of gross floor area. The building typically houses a single tenant. 
It is a location where affairs of a business, commercial or industrial organization, or professional 
person or firm are conducted. General office building (Land Use 710) is a related use.
Additional Data
Attorney office, mortgage company, financial advisor, insurance agency, home health care 
provider, and real estate company are examples of tenants included in the small office building 
database. The diversity of employer types results in a wide range in employee density in the 
database. Densities range from a high of 1,300 to a low of 240 square feet per employee with an 
overall average of nearly 600 square feet per employee (a value much larger than the average 
observed in a general office building study sites).
In addition to the significant difference in employee density, small office buildings tend to be 
dominated by a single tenant (or very few) that are more service-oriented than a typical general 
office building. The result is more frequent and regular visitors and higher trip generation rates.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), California, Texas, and 
Wisconsin.

Medical-Dental Office Building
Description
A medical-dental office building is a facility that provides diagnoses and outpatient care on a 
routine basis but is unable to provide prolonged in-house medical and surgical care. One or more 
private physicians or dentists generally operate this type of facility. General office building (Land 
Use 710) and clinic (Land Use 630) are related uses.
Land Use Subcategory
Analysis of medical-dental office building data found that trip generation rates are measurably 
different for sites located within or adjacent to a hospital campus and sites that are stand-alone. 
Data plots are presented for these two land use subcategories.
Additional Data

Description
A research and development center is a facility or group of facilities devoted almost exclusively to 
research and development activities. The range of specific types of businesses contained in this 
land use category varies significantly. Research and development centers may contain offices and 
light fabrication areas. General office building (Land Use 710), corporate headquarters building 
(Land Use 714), single tenant office building (Land Use 715), office park (Land Use 750), and 
business park (Land Use 770) are related uses.
Additional Data
The average numbers of person trips per vehicle trip at the 11 general urban/suburban sites at 
which both person trip and vehicle trip data were collected were as follows:
•	 1.4 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 7 and 9 a.m.
•	 1.4 during Weekday, AM Peak Hour of Generator
•	 1.4 during Weekday, Peak Hour of Adjacent Street Traffic, one hour between 4 and 6 p.m.
•	 1.4 during Weekday, PM Peak Hour of Generator
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, and Pennsylvania.

Business Park
Description
A business park consists of a group of flex-type or incubator one- or two-story buildings served by 
a common roadway system. The tenant space is flexible and lends itself to a variety of uses. The 
rear side of the building is often served by a garage door. Tenants may be start-up companies or 
small mature companies that require a variety of space. The space may include offices, retail and 
wholesale stores, restaurants, recreational areas and warehousing, manufacturing, light industrial,

Trip Generation Manual, 11th Edition (TGM) is a publication of the Institute of Transportation 
Engineers (ITE). TGM is an educational tool for planners, transportation professionals, zoning boards, 
and others who are interested in estimating trip generation at a proposed development.
TGM includes a complete set of searchable electronic files including land use descriptions and 
data plots for all available combinations of land uses, time periods, independent variables, and 
settings. Data contained in TGM are presented for informational purposes only and do not include 
ITE recommendations on the best course of action or the preferred application of the data. The 
information is based on trip generation studies submitted voluntarily to ITE by public agencies, 
developers, consulting firms, student chapters, and associations.
TGM provides access for users to the ITETripGen web app. This desktop application allows electronic 
access to the entire trip generation dataset with numerous filtering capabilities including site setting 
(i.e., rural, general urban/suburban, dense multi-use urban, center city core), geographic location, age 
of data, and development size. Instructions for using ITETripGen are included within the app.
Additional data are needed from the profession to create a data-rich environment for trip generation 
analysis. ITE will continue to prepare updates to TGM.
User comments on TGM are invited. ITE continually seeks ways to increase the value of this document 
and requests that users provide recently collected data for the land uses presented in TGM or any 
other land uses for inclusion in future editions and updates.
Although this report provides a powerful tool to better understand site-generated vehicle and person 
trips, it contains information that can also be easily misinterpreted without sound professional 
judgment. Users are cautioned to use professional judgment in applying all data contained in this 
report. They also need to be cognizant of site and area characteristics that can affect trip generation 
(e.g., availability of transit services, demand management strategies, parking pricing) and of the 
continued need for additional data. Lack of appreciation of these factors may lead to an inaccurate 
estimate of vehicle and person trip generation and ultimately the improper design of person and 
vehicle site access.

Description
A tractor supply store is a free-standing facility that specializes in the sale of agricultural and 
garden equipment, power tools, vehicle maintenance parts, and heavy-duty outdoor machinery. It 
may also offer ancillary items such as clothing, footwear, and other accessories.
Additional Data
An outside storage area is not included in the overall gross floor area measurements. However, if 
the storage area is located within the principal outside faces of the exterior walls, it is included in 
the overall gross floor area of the building.
The sites were surveyed in the 2000s in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.

Free-Standing Discount Superstore
Description
A discount superstore is similar to a free-standing discount store described in Land Use 815 with 
the exception that it also contains a full-service grocery department under the same roof that 
shares entrances and exits with the discount store area. These stores usually offer a variety of 
customer services, centralized cashiering, and a wide range of products. They typically maintain 
long store hours 7 days a week. The stores included in this land use are often the only ones on 
the site, but they can also be found in mutual operation with a related or unrelated garden center 
or service station, or as a part of a shopping center, with or without their own dedicated parking 
area. Freestanding discount store (Land Use 815) is a related use.
Additional Data
A garden center contained within the principal outside faces of the exterior building walls is 
included in the reported gross floor area. An outdoor or fenced-in area outside the principal faces 
of the exterior walls is excluded. Several sites included in this land use indicate the presence of 
fenced/covered space.
A Texas Transportation Institute study titled “Nationwide Discount Supercenter Study” published in 
2008 provides information on trip generation rates for what the study defines as “typical” and “peak” 
seasons. The peak season is defined as the period between the week after Thanksgiving and the 
week prior to Christmas. The typical season is defined as September through mid-November when 
sales transactions are close to the annual average. The following are their key findings:
•	 Weekday trip generation rates are similar in both seasons
•	 Saturday trip generation rates are 13 to 20 percent higher during the peak season than the 
typical season
•	 Sunday trip generation rates are 6 to 10 percent higher during the peak season
The weighted average truck trip generation rates from approximately 30 sites surveyed for this 
land use are summarized in the table below. The average gross floor area of these facilities is 
206,000 square feet.

To assist in the future analysis of this land use, it is important to collect and include information 
on the presence and size of garden centers, outdoor fenced-in space, and service stations in trip 
generation data submissions.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alabama, Arkansas, 
California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Variety Store
Description
A variety store is a retail store that sells a broad range of inexpensive items often at a uniform 
price. A variety store is commonly referred to as a “dollar store.” Items typically sold at a variety 
store include kitchen supplies, cleaning products, home office supplies, food products, household 
goods, decorations, and toys. The store can be stand-alone or located within a shopping plaza or 
strip retail plaza. Free-standing discount store (Land Use 815) is a related use.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s and 2020s in Florida, Minnesota, and Texas.

Free-Standing Discount Store
Description
A discount store is similar to a free-standing discount superstore (Land Use 813) with the 
exception that it does not contain a full-service grocery department. It is also similar to a 
department store (Land Use 875) with the exception that it generally offers centralized cashiering 
and sells products that are advertised at discount prices. Discount stores offer a variety of 
customer services and typically maintain long store hours 7 days a week. The stores included in 
this land use are often the only ones on the site but they can also be found in mutual operation 
with a related or unrelated garden center and/or service station. A free-standing discount store 
can also be found on a separate parcel within a retail complex, with or without its own dedicated 
parking. Freestanding discount superstore (Land Use 813), variety store (Land Use 814), and 
department store (Land Use 875) are related uses.
Additional Data
A garden center contained within the principal outside faces of the exterior building walls is 
included in the reported gross floor areas. An outdoor or fenced-in area outside the principal 
outside faces of the exterior building walls is excluded.
To assist in the future analysis of this land use, it is important to collect and include information 
on the presence and size of garden centers, outdoor fenced-in space and service stations in trip 
generation data submissions.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New 
Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.

Nursery (Garden Center)
Description
A nursery or garden center is a free-standing building with an outside storage area for planting 
or landscape stock. The nurseries surveyed primarily serve the general public. Some have large 
greenhouses and offer landscaping services. Most have office, storage, and shipping facilities.
Nurseries are characterized by seasonal variations in trip characteristics. Nursery (wholesale) 
(Land Use 818) is a related use.
Additional Data
An outside storage area is not included in the overall gross floor area measurements. However, if 
the storage area is located within the principal outside faces of the exterior walls, it is included in 
the overall gross floor area of the building.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s and the 2010s in California and Vermont.

Nursery (Wholesale)
Description
A wholesale nursery is a free-standing building with an outside storage area for planting or 
landscape stock. The nurseries surveyed primarily serve contractors and suppliers. Some have 
large greenhouses and offer landscaping services. Most have office, storage, and shipping 
facilities.
Nurseries are characterized by seasonal variations in trip characteristics. Nursery (garden center) 
(Land Use 817) is a related use.
Additional Data
An outside storage area is not included in the overall gross floor area measurements. However, if 
the storage area is located within the principal outside faces of the exterior walls, it is included in 
the overall gross floor area of the building.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s in California.

Land Use: 820
Shopping Center (>150k)
Description
A shopping center is an integrated group of commercial establishments that is planned, 
developed, owned, and managed as a unit. Each study site in this land use has at least 150,000 
square feet of gross leasable area (GLA). It often has more than one anchor store. Various names 
can be assigned to a shopping center within this size range, depending on its specific size and 
tenants, such as community center, regional center, superregional center, fashion center, and 
power center.
A shopping center of this size typically contains more than retail merchandising facilities. Office 
space, a movie theater, restaurants, a post office, banks, a health club, and recreational facilities 
are common tenants.
A shopping center of this size can be enclosed or open-air. The vehicle trips generated at a 
shopping center are based upon the total GLA of the center. In the case of a smaller center 
without an enclosed mall or peripheral buildings, the GLA is the same as the gross floor area of 
the building.
The 150,000 square feet GLA threshold value between community/regional shopping center and 
shopping plaza (Land Use 821) is based on an examination of trip generation data. For a shopping 
plaza that is smaller than the threshold value, the presence or absence of a supermarket within 
the plaza has a measurable effect on site trip generation. For a shopping center that is larger 
than the threshold value, the trips generated by its other major tenants mask any effects of the 
presence or absence of an on-site supermarket.
Shopping plaza (40-150k) (Land Use 821), strip retail plaza (<40k) (Land Use 822), and factory 
outlet center (Land Use 823) are related uses.
Additional Data
Many shopping centers—in addition to the integrated unit of shops in one building or enclosed 
around a mall—include outparcels (peripheral buildings or pads located on the perimeter of the 
center adjacent to the streets and major access points). These buildings are typically drive-in 
banks, retail stores, restaurants, or small offices. Although the data herein do not indicate which 
of the centers studied include peripheral buildings, it can be assumed that some of the data 
show their effect.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,

Land Use: 821
Shopping Plaza (40-150k)
Description
A shopping plaza is an integrated group of commercial establishments that is planned, developed, 
owned, and managed as a unit. Each study site in this land use has between 40,000 and 150,000 
square feet of gross leasable area (GLA). The term “plaza” in the land use name rather than 
“center” is simply a means of distinction between the different shopping center size ranges. 
Various other names are commonly used to categorize a shopping plaza within this size range, 
depending on its specific size and tenants, such as neighborhood center, community center, and 
fashion center.
Its major tenant is often a supermarket but many sites are anchored by home improvement, 
discount, or other stores. A shopping plaza typically contains more than retail merchandising 
facilities. Office space, a movie theater, restaurants, a post office, banks, a health club, and 
recreational facilities are common tenants. A shopping plaza is almost always open-air and the 
GLA is the same as the gross floor area of the building.
The 150,000 square feet GLA threshold value between shopping plaza and shopping center 
(Land Use 820) is based on an examination of trip generation data. For a shopping plaza that is 
smaller than the threshold value, the presence or absence of a supermarket within the plaza has 
a measurable effect on site trip generation. For a shopping center that is larger than the threshold 
value, the trips generated by its other major tenants mask any effects of the presence or absence 
of an on-site supermarket.
The 40,000 square feet GFA threshold between shopping plaza and strip retail plaza (Land Use 
822) was selected based on an examination of the overall shopping center/plaza database. No 
shopping plaza with a supermarket as its anchor is smaller than 40,000 square feet GLA.
Shopping center (>150k) (Land Use 820), strip retail plaza (<40k) (Land Use 822), and factory 
outlet center (Land Use 823) are related uses.
Land Use Subcategory
The presence or absence of a supermarket in a shopping plaza has been determined to have a 
measurable effect on site trip generation. Therefore, data are presented for two subcategories for 
this land use: sites with a supermarket anchor and sites without a supermarket.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).

Land Use: 822
Strip Retail Plaza (<40k)
Description
A strip retail plaza is an integrated group of commercial establishments that is planned, 
developed, owned, and managed as a unit. Each study site in this land use has less than 40,000 
square feet of gross leasable area (GLA). Because a strip retail plaza is open-air, the GLA is the 
same as the gross floor area of the building.
The 40,000 square feet GFA threshold between strip retail plaza and shopping plaza (Land Use 
821) was selected based on an examination of the overall shopping center/plaza database. No 
shopping plaza with a supermarket as its anchor is smaller than 40,000 square feet GLA.
Shopping center (>150k) (Land use 820), shopping plaza (40-150k) (Land Use 821), and factory 
outlet center (Land Use 823) are related uses.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Delaware, Florida, New Jersey, Ontario (CAN), South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, and 
Wisconsin.

Factory Outlet Center
Description
A factory outlet center is a shopping center that primarily houses factory outlet stores, attracting 
customers from a wide geographic area, very often from a larger area than a regional shopping 
center. Shopping center (>150k) (Land Use 820) is a related use.
Additional Data
Organized bus trips may serve the factory outlet centers. Information on the number of tour bus or 
transit trips serving the study sites is not available.
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s in California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, 
Oregon, Tennessee, and Virginia.
Specialized Land Use Data
A 1998 study provided data for a large outlet shopping center in California that contains 
more than 200 stores, numerous entertainment venues, full-service restaurants, and a home 
improvement superstore (source 518). The size and scale of this site differ considerably from the 
sites contained in this land use or of any other land use in Trip Generation Manual. The site has 
1,209,000 square feet occupied gross floor area and 975,000 square feet gross leasable area. The 
site generates 1,853 vehicle trips during the weekday PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic.

Automobile Sales (New)
Description
A new automobile sales dealership is typically located along a major arterial street characterized 
by abundant commercial development. The sale or leasing of new cars is the primary business at 
these facilities. However, the land use also commonly provides automobile servicing, parts sales, 
and used car sales. The dealerships may also provide truck sales and servicing. Automobile sales 
(used) (Land Use 841) and recreational vehicle sales (Land Use 842) are related uses.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Ontario (CAN), Oregon, 
Texas, Vermont, and Virginia.

Tire Store
Description
The primary business associated with a tire store is the sale of tires for automotive vehicles. 
Services offered by these stores usually include tire installation and repair, as well as other 
automotive maintenance or repair services and customer assistance. These stores generally do not 
contain large storage or warehouse areas. Automobile parts sales (Land Use 843), tire superstore 
(Land Use 849), and automobile parts and service center (Land Use 943) are related uses.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Florida, Minnesota, 
New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

Tire Superstore
Description
A tire superstore is a warehouse-like facility with the primary function of selling and installing tires 
for automobiles and small trucks. Other services provided may include automotive maintenance 
functions such as wheel alignment or shock and brake service and customer services. A tire 
display, customer waiting lounge, restroom facilities, staff office space, and significant storage 
area are also provided. General mechanical repairs and bodywork are usually not conducted at 
these facilities. Automobile parts sales (Land Use 843), tire store (Land Use 848), and automobile 
parts and service center (Land Use 943) are related uses.
Additional Data
The superstores surveyed for this land use typically provide storage for approximately 5,000 
tires. The sites were surveyed in the 1990s in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and 
Pennsylvania.

Supermarket
Description
A supermarket is a free-standing retail store that sells a complete assortment of food, beverage, 
food preparation materials, and household products. A supermarket may also provide additional 
products and services such as a bakery, dry cleaning, floral arrangements, greeting cards, a 
limited-service bank, and a pharmacy.
Additional Data
In prior editions of Trip Generation Manual, a separate land use code was assigned to a discount 
supermarket. With the addition of new supermarket data points, an examination of the database 
reveals very little difference between trip generation rates for the traditional supermarket and a 
reported discount supermarket. This examination looked at both the small discount supermarkets 
and the large discount supermarkets. As a result, all types of supermarkets are included in this 
land use database.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, the 2010s, and the 2020s in Alberta 
(CAN), California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, 
Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ontario (CAN), Oregon, Pennsylvania, South 
Dakota, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Convenience Store
Description
A convenience store is a small retail business that sells grocery and other everyday items that a 
person may need or want as a matter of convenience. Convenience stores are typically located 
along major thoroughfares to optimize motorist convenience. Extended hours of operation (with 
many open 24 hours, 7 days a week) further support the convenience of the store. A convenience 
store is also commonly called a convenience market.
The product mix typically includes pre-packaged grocery items, beverages, dairy products, snack 
foods, confectionary, tobacco products, over-the-counter drugs, and toiletries. A convenience 
store may sell alcohol, often limited to beer and wine.
Coffee and pre-made sandwiches are also commonly sold at a convenience store. Made-to-order 
food orders are sometimes offered. Some stores offer limited seating.
Convenience store/gas station (Land Use 945) is a related use.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), Arizona, 
California, New Jersey, New York, Ontario, Canada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia.

Discount Club
Description
A discount club is a discount store or warehouse where shoppers pay a membership fee in order 
to take advantage of discounted prices on a wide variety of items such as food, beverages, 
household items, clothing, tires, and appliances. Many items are sold in large quantities or bulk. 
Some sites may include on-site fueling pumps.
Additional Data
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alabama, Alberta 
(CAN), California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, 
Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington.
To assist in the future analysis of this land use, it is important to collect and include information 
on the presence of vehicle fueling stations in trip generation data submissions.

wholesale market has little drive-in business. Truck deliveries and pick-ups take place at all hours 
of the day.
Additional Data
The sites were surveyed in the 2000s in New Jersey.

Sporting Goods Superstore
Description
A sporting goods superstore is a free-standing facility that specializes in the sale of athletic and 
outdoor-oriented merchandise. It typically offers a variety of customer services and centralized 
cashiering and maintains long store hours 7 days a week. Examples of items sold in these stores 
include outdoor/athletic clothing, sports equipment, shoes, and hunting/boating/fishing gear. 
Some may also carry automotive supplies. A sporting goods superstore is sometimes placed as a 
separate parcel within a retail complex, with or without its own dedicated parking.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2000s and the 2010s in California, Florida, Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Home Improvement Superstore
Description
A home improvement superstore is a free-standing facility that specializes in the sale of home 
improvement merchandise. The store generally offers a variety of customer services and centralized 
cashiering. A home improvement superstore typically maintains long store hours 7 days a week. 
Examples of items sold in the store include lumber, tools, paint, lighting, wallpaper and paneling, 
kitchen and bathroom fixtures, lawn equipment, and plant and garden accessories. The stores 
included in this land use are often the only ones on the site, but they can also be found in mutual 
operation with a related or unrelated garden center. A home improvement superstore is sometimes 
placed as a separate parcel within a retail complex, with or without its own dedicated parking. The 
buildings contained in this land use usually range in size between 50,000 and 200,000 square feet 
gross floor area. This land use does not include interior design stores. Building materials and lumber 
store (Land Use 812) and hardware/paint store (Land Use 816) are related uses.
Additional Data
Outside storage areas are not included in the overall gross floor area measurements. However, if a 
storage area is located within the principal outside faces of the exterior walls, it is included in the 
overall gross floor area of the building.
A garden center that is contained within the principal outside faces of the exterior building walls is 
included in the reported gross floor area. An outdoor or fenced-in area outside the principal faces 
of the exterior building walls is excluded.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Arizona, California, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Ontario 
(CAN), Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
To assist in the future analysis of this land use, it is important to collect and include information 
on the presence and size of garden centers, outdoor fenced-in space, and service stations in trip 
generation data submissions.

Electronic Superstore
Description
An electronics superstore is a free-standing facility that specializes in the sale of electronic 
merchandise. A superstore generally offers a variety of customer services and centralized 
cashiering and typically maintains long store hours 7 days a week. Examples of items sold in 
these stores include televisions, audio and video players and recorders, software, telephones, 
computers, and general electronic accessories. Major home appliances may also be sold at these 
facilities. An electronics superstore is sometimes placed as a separate parcel within a retail 
complex, with or without its own dedicated parking.
Additional Data
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s and the 2010s in Florida and Minnesota.

Walk-in Bank
Description
A bank is a financial institution that that can offer a wide variety of financial services. A walk-in 
bank does not have drive-in lanes but typically has a non-drive-through automatic teller machine 
(ATM). A walk-in bank can be free-standing with its own parking lot or part of a larger retail 
complex. Drive-in bank (Land Use 912) is a related use.
Additional Data
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s and the 2000s in Alberta (CAN) and California.
To assist in the future analysis of this land use, it is important that Friday data be collected and 
reported separately from weekday data. It is also important to specify the date and month of the 
data collection period.

Drive-in Bank
Description
A bank is a financial institution that can offer a wide variety of financial services. A drive-in bank 
provides banking services for a motorist through a teller station. A drive-in bank may also serve 
patrons who walk into the building. The drive-in lanes may or may not provide an automatic teller 
machine (ATM). Walk-in bank (Land Use 911) is a related use.
Additional Data
The independent variable—drive-in lanes—refers to all lanes at a banking facility used for financial 
transactions, including ATM-only lanes.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2000s and the 2010s in Colorado, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, 
New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.
To assist in the future analysis of this land use, it is important that Friday data be collected and 
reported separately from weekday data. It is also important to specify the date and month of the data 
collection period and the number of drive-through lanes that are open at the time of the study.

Food Cart Pod
Description
A food cart pod is a group of food carts or food trucks congregated in an established location, 
such as a parking lot, on a semi-permanent or regular basis. A food cart pod typically operates 
during both the lunch and dinner timeframes. A food cart pod often includes limited covered 
seating or a dining area. A food cart pod may also include the sale of alcoholic beverages.
Additional Data
All data were collected in the summer months. Most sites were located along public transit routes 
and some were accessible by bike or multi-use paths. The independent variable “food cart” is 
defined for the purpose of this land use as the number of food carts open at the time of the study.
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in Oregon.

Fast Casual Restaurant
Description
A fast casual restaurant is a sit-down restaurant with no (or very limited) wait staff or table 
service. A customer typically orders off a menu board, pays for food before the food is prepared, 
and seats themselves. The menu generally contains higher-quality, made-to-order food items 
with fewer frozen or processed ingredients than at a fast-food restaurant. Most patrons eat their 
meal within the restaurant, but a significant proportion of the restaurant sales can be carry-out 
orders. A fast casual restaurant typically serves lunch and dinner; some serve breakfast. A typical 
duration of stay for an eat-in customer is 40 minutes or less. Fine dining restaurant (Land Use 
931), high-turnover (sit-down) restaurant (Land Use 932), and fast-food restaurant without drive-
through window (Land Use 933) are related uses.
Additional Data
The fast casual restaurant study sites included in this land use did not have a drive-through window.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in Minnesota, South Carolina, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Fine Dining Restaurant
Description
A fine dining restaurant is a full-service eating establishment with a typical duration of stay of at 
least 1 hour. A fine dining restaurant generally does not serve breakfast; some do not serve lunch; 
all serve dinner. This type of restaurant often requests and sometimes requires a reservation and is 
generally not part of a chain. A patron commonly waits to be seated, is served by wait staff, orders 
from a menu and pays after the meal. Some of the study sites have lounge or bar facilities (serving 
alcoholic beverages), but meal service is the primary draw to the restaurant. Fast casual restaurant 
(Land Use 930) and high-turnover (sit-down) restaurant (Land Use 932) are related uses.
Additional Data
If the fine dining restaurant has outdoor seating, its area is not included in the overall gross floor 
area. For a restaurant that has significant outdoor seating, the number of seats may be more 
reliable than GFA as an independent variable on which to establish a trip generation rate.
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), California, 
Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, New Jersey, and Utah.

Land Use: 932
High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant
Description
This land use consists of sit-down, full-service eating establishments with a typical duration of 
stay of 60 minutes or less. This type of restaurant is usually moderately priced, frequently belongs 
to a restaurant chain, and is commonly referred to as casual dining. Generally, these restaurants 
serve lunch and dinner; they may also be open for breakfast and are sometimes open 24 hours 
a day. These restaurants typically do not accept reservations. A patron commonly waits to be 
seated, is served by wait staff, orders from a menu, and pays after the meal.
Some facilities offer carry-out for a small proportion of its customers. Some facilities within this 
land use may also contain a bar area for serving food and alcoholic drinks.
Fast casual restaurant (Land Use 930), fine dining restaurant (Land Use 931), fast-food restaurant 
without drive-through window (Land Use 933), and fast-food restaurant with drive-through window 
(Land Use 934) are related uses.
Additional Data
Users should exercise caution when applying statistics during the AM peak periods, as the sites 
contained in the database for this land use may or may not be open for breakfast. In cases where 
it was confirmed that the sites were not open for breakfast, data for the AM peak hour of the 
adjacent street traffic were removed from the database.
If the restaurant has outdoor seating, its area is not included in the overall gross floor area. For 
a restaurant that has significant outdoor seating, the number of seats may be more reliable than 
GFA as an independent variable on which to establish a trip generation rate.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New 
Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, 
Vermont, and Wisconsin.

Land Use: 933
Fast-Food Restaurant without Drive-Through Window
Description
This land use includes any fast-food restaurant without a drive-through window. This type of 
restaurant is characterized by a large carry-out clientele, long hours of service (some are open 
for breakfast, all are open for lunch and dinner, some are open late at night or 24 hours a day) 
and high turnover rates for eat-in customers. These limited-service eating establishments do not 
provide table service. A patron generally orders from a menu board and pays before receiving 
the meal. A typical duration of stay for an eat-in customer is less than 30 minutes. Fast casual 
restaurant (Land Use 930), high-turnover (sit-down) restaurant (Land Use 932), and fast-food 
restaurant with drive-through window (Land Use 934) are related uses.
Additional Data
If the restaurant has outdoor seating, its area is not included in the overall gross floor area. For 
a restaurant that has significant outdoor seating, the number of seats may be more reliable than 
GFA as an independent variable on which to establish a trip generation rate.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), California, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Maryland, Montana, Pennsylvania, and Texas.

Land Use: 934
Fast-Food Restaurant with Drive-Through Window
Description
This land use includes any fast-food restaurant with a drive-through window. This type of 
restaurant is characterized by a large drive-through and large carry-out clientele, long hours of 
service (some are open for breakfast, all are open for lunch and dinner, some are open late at 
night or 24 hours a day) and high turnover rates for eat-in customers. The restaurant does not 
provide table service. A patron generally orders from a menu board and pays before receiving the 
meal. A typical duration of stay for an eat-in patron is less than 30 minutes. Fast casual restaurant 
(Land Use 930), high-turnover (sit-down) restaurant (Land Use 932), fast-food restaurant without 
drive-through window (Land Use 933), and fast-food restaurant with drive-through window and no 
indoor seating (Land Use 935) are related uses.
Additional Data
Users should exercise caution when applying statistics during the AM peak periods, as the sites 
contained in the database for this land use may or may not be open for breakfast. In cases where 
it was confirmed that the sites were not open for breakfast, data for the AM peak hour of the 
adjacent street traffic were removed from the database.
If the restaurant has outdoor seating, its area is not included in the overall gross floor area. For 
a restaurant that has significant outdoor seating, the number of seats may be more reliable than 
GFA as an independent variable on which to establish a trip generation rate.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alaska, Alberta 
(CAN), California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, 
Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South 
Dakota, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Land Use: 936
Coffee/Donut Shop without Drive-Through Window
Description
This land use includes any coffee and donut restaurant that does not have a drive-through 
window. The restaurant sells freshly brewed coffee (along with coffee-related accessories) and a 
variety of food/drink products such as donuts, bagels, breads, muffins, cakes, sandwiches, wraps, 
salads, and other hot and cold beverages. The restaurant marketing and sales may emphasize 
coffee beverages over food (or vice versa).
A coffee/donut shop typically holds long store hours (more than 15 hours) with an early morning 
opening. Limited indoor seating is generally provided for patrons, but table service is not provided.
Coffee/donut shop with drive-through window (Land Use 937) and coffee/donut shop with drive-
through window and no indoor seating (Land Use 938) are related uses.
Additional Data
Many of the facilities in this land use were located within a shopping center or as an outparcel to 
a shopping center.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.
Specialized Land Use Data
One study provided data for a coffee/donut shop without a drive-through window that sells 
donuts and ice cream (source 563). The trip generating characteristics of this site differed from 
the sites included in this land use; therefore, trip generation information for this site is presented 
here and was excluded from the data plots. The site had a gross floor area of 2,400 square feet. 
It generated 48 vehicle trips during the weekday PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic and 52 
vehicle trips during the weekday PM peak hour of the generator.

Land Use: 937
Coffee/Donut Shop with Drive-Through Window
Description
This land use includes any coffee and donut restaurant that has a drive-through window as well as 
a walk-in entrance area at which a patron can purchase and consume items. The restaurant sells 
freshly brewed coffee (along with coffee-related accessories) and a variety of food/drink products 
such as donuts, bagels, breads, muffins, cakes, sandwiches, wraps, salads, and other hot and cold 
beverages. The restaurant marketing and sales may emphasize coffee beverages over food (or 
vice versa).
A coffee/donut shop typically holds long store hours (more than 15 hours) with an early morning 
opening. Limited indoor seating is generally provided for patrons, but table service is not provided.
Coffee/donut shop without drive-through window (Land Use 936) and coffee/donut shop with 
drive-through window and no indoor seating (Land Use 938) are related uses.
Additional Data
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in California, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, 
Ontario (CAN), Pennsylvania, Quebec (CAN), Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
Specialized Land Use Data
One study was conducted during the pandemic in 2020. Twelve sites were counted in Illinois and 
Missouri during the AM and PM adjacent street peak hours. The data have not been incorporated 
within the overall ITE trip generation database and are not reflected in the data plots for this land 
use. Consideration for their inclusion will be given for the 12th Edition of Trip Generation Manual 
after additional post-pandemic data are collected. Overall, the pandemic counts yielded an AM 
adjacent street peak weighted average rate of 84 vehicle trips per 1,000 square feet GFA, roughly 
equivalent to the pre-pandemic average. The PM adjacent street peak rate was 56 (roughly 40 
percent higher than the pre-pandemic value). The higher PM peak rate for these coffee/donut 
shops conforms with anecdotal observations that with the temporary or permanent closures of 
many restaurants during the pandemic, the drive-through restaurants that were open did a brisk 
business even during their off-peak periods.

Land Use: 938
Coffee/Donut Shop with Drive-Through Window and 
No Indoor Seating
Description
This land use includes any coffee and donut restaurant that has only drive-through window 
service. A patron cannot walk into the shop and purchase items. The restaurant sells freshly 
brewed coffee (along with coffee-related accessories) and a variety of food/drink products such 
as donuts, bagels, breads, muffins, cakes, sandwiches, wraps, salads, and other hot and cold 
beverages. The restaurant marketing and sales may emphasize coffee beverages over food (or 
vice versa).
The coffee/donut shops contained in this land use typically hold long store hours (more than 15 
hours) with an early morning opening.
Coffee/donut shop without drive-through window (Land Use 936) and coffee/donut shop with 
drive-through window (Land Use 937) are related uses.
Additional Data
The sites were surveyed in the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Arizona, New Hampshire, 
Oregon, and Washington.

Land Use: 944
Gasoline/Service Station
Description
This land use includes gasoline/service stations where the primary business is the fueling of 
motor vehicles. The sites included generally have a small building (less than 2,000 gross square 
feet) that houses a cashier and limited space for motor vehicle maintenance supplies and general 
convenience products. A gasoline/service station may also have facilities for servicing and 
repairing motor vehicles. The gasoline/service station may also have a car wash. Convenience 
store/gas station (Land Use 945) and truck stop (Land Use 950) are related uses.
Additional Data
The independent variable—vehicle fueling positions—is defined as the maximum number of 
vehicles that can be fueled simultaneously. The sites in this land use include both self-pump and 
attendant-pumped fueling positions and both pre-pay and post-pay operations.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, 
Ontario (CAN), Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, and Washington.
Specialized Land Use Data
A 2006 study provided data on four private fuel facilities in Florida (source 721). These facilities 
provide self-fuel service for any motorist with a pre-established membership account. The site is 
not open to the general public. The trip generation characteristics of these sites differ from sites 
included in this land use; therefore, trip generation information for these sites is excluded from the 
data plots. The four sites have an average of nine vehicle fueling positions, with an average of 12 
vehicle trips during the weekday, AM peak hour of adjacent traffic and 7 vehicle trips during the 
weekday, PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic.

Land Use: 945
Convenience Store/Gas Station
Description
A convenience store/gas station is a facility with a co-located convenience store and gas station. 
The convenience store sells grocery and other everyday items that a person may need or want as 
a matter of convenience. The gas station sells automotive fuels such as gasoline and diesel.
A convenience store/gas station is typically located along a major thoroughfare to optimize 
motorist convenience. Extended hours of operation (with many open 24 hours, 7 days a week) are 
common at these facilities.
The convenience store product mix typically includes pre-packaged grocery items, beverages, 
dairy products, snack foods, confectionary, tobacco products, over-the-counter drugs, and 
toiletries. A convenience store may sell alcohol, often limited to beer and wine. Coffee and pre-
made sandwiches are also commonly sold at a convenience store. Made-to-order food orders are 
sometimes offered. Some stores offer limited seating.
The sites in this land use include both self-pump and attendant-pumped fueling positions and 
both pre-pay and post-pay operations.
Convenience store (Land Use 851), gasoline/service station (Land Use 944), and truck stop (Land 
Use 950) are related uses.
Land Use Subcategory
Multiple subcategories were added to this land use to allow for multi-variable evaluation of sites 
with single-variable data plots. All study sites are assigned to one of three subcategories, based 
on the number of vehicle fueling positions (VFP) at the site: between 2 and 8 VFP, between 9 and 
15 VFP, and between 16 and 24 VFP. For each VFP range subcategory, data plots are presented 
with GFA as the independent variable for all time periods and trip types for which data are 
available. The use of both GFA and VFP (as the independent variable and land use subcategory, 
respectively) provides a significant improvement in the reliability of a trip generation estimate 
when compared to the single-variable data plots in prior editions of Trip Generation Manual.
Further, the study sites were also assigned to one of three other subcategories, based on the 
gross floor area (GFA) of the convenience store at the site: between 2,000 and 4,000 square 
feet, between 4,000 and 5,500 square feet, and between 5,500 and 10,000 square feet. For each 
GFA subcategory range, data plots are presented with VFP as the independent variable for all 
time periods and trip types for which data are available. The use of both VFP and GFA (as the 
independent variable and land use subcategory, respectively) provides a significant improvement 
in the reliability of a trip generation estimate when compared to the single-variable data plots in 
prior editions of Trip Generation Manual.
864
Trip Generation Manual 11th Edition • Volume 5

--- Page 877 ---
When analyzing the convenience store/gas station land use with each combination of GFA and 
VFP values as described above, the two sets of data plots will produce two estimates of site-
generated trips. Both values can be considered when determining a site trip generation estimate.
Data plots are also provided for three additional independent variables: AM peak hour traffic 
on adjacent street, PM peak hour traffic on adjacent street, and employees. These independent 
variables are intended to be analyzed as single independent variables and do not have sub-
categories associated with them. Within the data plots and within the ITETripGen web app, these 
plots are found under the land use subcategory “none.”
Additional Data
ITE recognizes there are existing convenience store/gas station sites throughout North America 
that are larger than the sites presented in the data plots. However, the ITE database does not 
include any site with more than 24 VFP or any site with gross floor area greater than 10,000 
square feet. Submission of trip generation data for larger sites is encouraged.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s in Alberta (CAN), 
Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, 
South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Truck Stop
Description
A truck stop is a facility located adjacent to an interstate highway interchange that provides 
commercial vehicle fueling, space and supplies for self-service vehicle maintenance, and other 
services specific to the needs of truckers (e.g., showers, on-site truck parking area). The facility 
typically contains a convenience store, restroom facilities, and one or more restaurants (either 
fast-food or high-turnover sit-down). Gasoline/service station (Land Use 944) and convenience 
store/gas station (Land Use 945) are related uses.
Additional Data
The trip generation data presented for this land use constitute commercial truck trips only.
The independent variable used in the data plots (vehicle fueling positions) refers to only the 
commercial fueling lanes at the truck stop.
The convenience store, restrooms, and restaurant(s) associated with a truck stop typically are 
also open to the general motoring public. The site often also includes vehicle fueling positions 
for the general motoring public. Additional information is needed in order to estimate non-truck 
vehicle trips generated by truck stops.
The truck trip generation rates per vehicle fueling position appear unreasonably high considering 
the length of time a trucker needs to fuel a vehicle. However, the detailed information provided in 
the data sources support the validity of the truck counts. It is apparent that not all trucks entering 
or exiting the truck stop are refueled. In those circumstances, the trucker could be using other 
services provided by the truck stop.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2000s and the 2010s in Colorado, Florida, Tennessee, Vermont, and 
Virginia.
To assist in the future analysis of this land use, it is important that the number of gasoline and 
diesel pumps at the study site be reported. It is also important to collect additional information 
on the number of non-truck trips generated at these sites.

Wine Tasting Room
Description
A wine tasting room is a designated area found in conjunction with a winery in which customers 
can try samples of a winery’s products. These rooms are typically located on-site and can be 
used as a way to sell wine or related products directly to the customer. Depending on its size, a 
tasting room can also be used to house wedding receptions, corporate events, and other social 
gatherings. A wine tasting room may also be used to facilitate complimentary tours of the winery.
Additional Data
For the purposes of this land use, the independent variable “1,000 sq. foot gross floor area” refers 
to the square footage of the building that houses the tasting room.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in California, Illinois, and Virginia.

Brewery Tap Room
Description
A brewery tap room is a designated area found in conjunction with a brewery in which customers 
can try samples of a brewery’s products. These rooms are typically located on-site and can be 
used as a way to sell beer or related products directly to the customer. Depending on its size, a 
tap room can also be used to house social gatherings. A brewery tap room may also be used to 
facilitate complimentary tours of the brewery.
Additional Data
For the purposes of this land use, the independent variable “1,000 sq. foot gross floor area” refers 
to the square footage of the building that houses the tap room.
The technical appendices provide supporting information on time-of-day distributions for this 
land use. The appendices can be accessed through either the ITETripGen web app or the trip 
generation resource page on the ITE website (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/trip-
and-parking-generation/).
The sites were surveyed in the 2010s in Florida and Minnesota.
